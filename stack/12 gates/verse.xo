  block |The Prologue|
    block
      block |Childe of this discipline incline to me thine eare|
      block |And harkē to my doctrine with al thy diligēce|
      block |These words of wisedome in minde doe thou beare,|
      block |Which of olde fathers be true in sentence:|
      block |Liue cleane in soule, to God doe no offence.|
      block |Exalt thee not but rather keepe thee lowe,|
      block |Else will thy God in thee no wisdome sowe.|
    block
      block |From sinfull doctrine and wicked thought,|
      block |The holy spirite doth him withdraw,|
      block |Nilling to dwell where sinne is wrought:|
      block |Dread God therefore and obey his law:|
      block |A righteous man forsooke I neuer sawe:|
      block |Neyther his seede begge bread for neede:|
      block |In holy scripture this doe I reede.|
    block
      block |Make wisdome therefore thy mother to be,|
      block |And call on Prudence to be thy friend,|
      block |By pathes of truth they will guide thee,|
      block |With loue and honesty wheresoeuer thou wend:|
      block |Both vertuous to be, curteous and hend:|
      block |Pray God therefore that thou maist finde,|
      block |Wisedome and Prudence with mouth and minde.|
    block
      block |All manner good come with them shall,|
      block |And honestie by their hands innumerable,|
      block |Then into cumbrance shalt thou not fall,|
      block |So be they in riches incomparable:|
      block |To worship and profite they will thee able,|
      block |To cunning and all manner of grace,|
      block |Both here and after thy liues space.|
    block
      block |For these benefites which they doe bring,|
      block |I meane these vertues of prudence and sapience,|
      block |To whome I can compare nothing,|
      block |No riches, nor spices of redolence,|
      block |Aboue all treasure such is their excellence,|
      block |That whatsoeuer earthly precious is,|
      block |To them is compared as clay I wis.|
    block
      block |Infinite treasure to man they be,|
      block |Who vseth them shall friendship haue|
      block |With God in heauen and there him see,|
      block |After them therefore busily craue,|
      block |For bodie and soule they will both saue,|
      block |And here in goods thee multiply;|
      block |And afore princes thee dignifie.|
    block
      block |Thinke how Adam lost his wisedome,|
      block |Sampson his might which was so strong:|
      block |King Saule also lost his kingdome,|
      block |And Dauid was punished for his wrong:|
      block |In the Oke by the haire fayre Absolon hong,|
      block |King Ezechias by sicknes had punishment,|
      block |And many one moe for sinne was shent.|
    block
      block |But see how other which liued weele,|
      block |And to their God did no offence,|
      block |Such chastisement did neuer feele;|
      block |But God sheweth euer to them beneuolence,|
      block |Enoch and Hely were carried hence,|
      block |To Paradice, and orher good liuers were|
      block |Of God rewarded in diuerse mannere.|
    block
      block |Some had great Fortune, some great cunning,|
      block |Some had great peace, some great riches,|
      block |Some conquered lands to their great wynning▪|
      block |Some were exalted for their great meeknes,|
      block |Some other were saued from the cruelnes|
      block |Of Tyrants, Lyons, and of the hot furnace,|
      block |As Daniel and others in many a place.|
    block
      block |Thus to good liuers God sent great grace,|
      block |And vnto sinners great and sore punishment,|
      block |Some to amend in this life had space,|
      block |Some sodainely with fire from heauen were brent,|
      block |Sinfull Sodomites for euer were shent,|
      block |With Dathan and Abiron with many moe,|
      block |Which sunke for sinne to endles woe.|
    block
      block |Thus euer sith this world was wrought,|
      block |God hath rewarded both euill and good:|
      block |Thus if it may rest in thy thought,|
      block |From sinfull liuing to change thy moode.|
      block |If sinfull people this vnderstoode,|
      block |They ought to be afrayde God to offend,|
      block |And soone their sinfull liues to amend.|
    block
      block |Therefore with God looke thou beginne,|
      block |That he by grace may dwell with thee,|
      block |So shalt thou best to wisdome winne;|
      block |And knowledge of our great priuitie:|
      block |Nourish vertues, and from vices flee,|
      block |And trusting thou wilt thee well dispose,|
      block |Our secrets to thee I will disclose.|
    block
      block |Keepe thou them secreate and for me pray,|
      block |Looke that thou vse them to Gods pleasure,|
      block |Doo good with them what euer thou may;|
      block |For time thou shalt this life indure,|
      block |That after thy ende thou mayst be sure|
      block |In heauen for to rewarded be,|
      block |Which God graunt both to me and thee.|

  block |The Preface.|
    block
      block |O High incomprehensible and glorious Maiestie,|
      block |Whose luminous beames obtundeth our specula∣tion,|
      block |O trinehood in persons ô onehood in deity, t|
      block |Of Iherarchiall Iubilists gratulant glorification,|
      block |O piteous purifier of soules and pure perpetuation,|
      block |O deuiant from danger, ô drawer most debonayre,|
      block |From this troublesome vale of vanitie, ô our Exalter.|
    block
      block |O power, ô wisdome, ô goodnes inexplicable,|
      block |Supporte me, teach me, and be my gouernor,|
      block |That neuer my liuing to thee be displicable,|
      block |But that I acquite me to thee as true professor,|
      block |At this beginning good Lord heare my prayer,|
      block |Be nigh with grace for to inforce my will,|
      block |Graunt witt that I may mine intent fulfill.|
    block
      block |Most curious Cofer and copious of all treasure,|
      block |Thou art he from whome all goodnes doth discend,|
      block |To man and also to euery creature,|
      block |Thine handy-work therefore vouchsafe to defend,|
      block |That we no time in liuing here mispend,|
      block |With troth here graunt vs our liuing so to winne,|
      block |That into no danger of sinfulnes we rinne.|
    block
      block |And forasumch as we haue for thy sake|
      block |Renounced our wills, the world and fleshly lust,|
      block |As thine owne professors vs to thee take,|
      block |Sith in thee onely dependeth all our trust;|
      block |We can no further; to thee incline we must:|
      block |Thy secret treasure vouchsafe vnto vs,|
      block |Shew vs thy secrets and to vs be bounteous.|
    block
      block |And amongst others which be profest to thee,|
      block |I me present as one with humble submission,|
      block |Thy seruant beseeching that I may bee,|
      block |And true in liuing according to my profession,|
      block |In order Chanon Reguler of Bridlington;|
      block |Beseeching thee Lord thou wilt me spare,|
      block |To thy true seruants thy secrets to declare.|
    block
      block |In the beginning when thou mad'st all of nought,|
      block |A globous matter and darke vnder confusion,|
      block |By him the beginning marueilously was wrought,|
      block |Conteyning naturally all things without diuision:|
      block |Of which in six dayes he made cleere distinction:|
      block |As Genesis apertly doth record.|
      block |Then heauen and earth were perfected by his word.|
    block
      block |So through his will and power, out of one mas|
      block |Confused; was made each thing that being is,|
      block |But afore in glory as maker he was,|
      block |Now is and shall be without end I wis,|
      block |And purified soules vp to his blis|
      block |Shall come a principle this may be one,|
      block |For the declaring of our precious stone.|
    block
      block |For as of one masse was made all thing,|
      block |Right so in our practize must it be,|
      block |All our secreats of one Image must spring,|
      block |As in Philosophers bookes whoso list to see,|
      block |Our stone is called the lesse world, one and three;|
      block |Magnesa also of sulphure and Mercurie,|
      block |Proportionate by nature most perfectlie.|
    block
      block |But many one marueileth and maruaile may,|
      block |And museth on such a marueilous thing,|
      block |What is our stone; sith Philosophers say|
      block |To such as euer be it in seeking.|
      block |For foules and fisshes to vs doth it bring,|
      block |Euery man it hath, and it is in euery place,|
      block |In thee in me, and in each thing, time and space?|
    block
      block |To this I answere that Mercurie it is I wis,|
      block |But not the common called quicksiluer by name,|
      block |But Mercurie without which nothing being is,|
      block |All Philosophers record and truely saine the same,|
      block |But simple searchers putteth them in blame,|
      block |Saying they hid it but they be blame worthy,|
      block |Which be no Clearkes and meddle with Philosophy.|
    block
      block |But though it Mercurie be, yet wisely vnderstand,|
      block |Wherein it is, and where thou shalt it seech,|
      block |Else I counsell thee take not this work in hand,|
      block |For Philosophers flatter fooles with fayre speech:|
      block |But listen to me, for truly I will thee teach,|
      block |Which is this Mercurie most profitable,|
      block |Being to thee nothing deceiueable.|
    block
      block |It is more neere in some things than in some;|
      block |Therefore take heede what I to thee write|
      block |For if knowledge to thee neuer come,|
      block |Therefore yet shalt thou me not twite,|
      block |For I will truely now thee excite|
      block |To vnderstand well Mercuries three,|
      block |The keyes which of this science bee.|
    block
      block |Raymond his menstrues doth them call,|
      block |Without which truly no trueth is done:|
      block |But two of them be superficiall,|
      block |The third essentiall of Sunne and Moone,|
      block |Their properties I will declare right soone,|
      block |And Mercurie of mettalls essentiall,|
      block |Is the principle of our stone materiall.|
    block
      block |In Sunne and Moone our Menstrue is not seene,|
      block |It appeareth not but by effect to sight,|
      block |That is the stone of which we meene,|
      block |Who so our writings conceiueth aright,|
      block |It is a soule, a substance bright.|
      block |Of Sunne and Moone a subtill influence,|
      block |Whereby the earth receiueth resplendence.|
    block
      block |For what is Sunne and Moone sayth Auicen,|
      block |But earth which is pure white and red:|
      block |Take from it the said cleerenes, and then|
      block |That earth will stand but in little stead;|
      block |The whole compound is called our lead:|
      block |The qualitie of clearenes from Sun and Moone dooth come,|
      block |These are our menstrues both all and some.|
    block
      block |Bodies with the first we calcine naturally|
      block |Perfect, but none which been vncleene,|
      block |Except one which is vsually|
      block |Named by Philosophers the Lyon greene:|
      block |He is the meane the Sunne and Moone betweene|
      block |Of winning tincture with perfectnes,|
      block |As Geber thereunto beareth witnes.|
    block
      block |With the second which is an humiditie|
      block |Vegitable, reuiuing that earst was dead,|
      block |Both principles materials must loosed be|
      block |And formalls, els stand they little in stead:|
      block |These menstrews therefore know I thee reed,|
      block |Without the which neither true calcination|
      block |Done may be, not true dissolution.|
    block
      block |With the third humiditie most permanent,|
      block |Incombustible and vnctuous in his nature,|
      block |Hermes tree vnto ashes is brent,|
      block |It is our naturall fire most sure,|
      block |Our Mercurie, our Sulphur, our tincture pure,|
      block |Our soule, our stone borne vp with winde|
      block |In the earth ingendred, beare this in minde.|
    block
      block |This stone also tell thee I dare,|
      block |Is the vapour of mettalls potentiall,|
      block |How thou shalt get it, thou must beware,|
      block |For inuisible truely is this menstruall,|
      block |Howbeit with the second water philosophicall,|
      block |By separation of Elements it may appeare|
      block |To sight, in forme of water cleare.|
    block
      block |If this menstrue by labour exuberate|
      block |With it may be made Sulphur of nature,|
      block |If it be well and kindly acuate|
      block |And circulate into a spirit pure,|
      block |Then to dissolue thou must be sure,|
      block |Thy base with it in diuers wise,|
      block |As thou shalt know by thy practise.|
    block
      block |That poynt therefore in his due place,|
      block |I will declare with other moe,|
      block |If God will graunt me grace and space,|
      block |And me preserue in life from woe,|
      block |As I thee teach looke thou doe so:|
      block |And for the first ground principall,|
      block |Vnderstand thy waters menstruall.|
    block
      block |And when thou hast made Calcination,|
      block |Encreasing not wasting moysture radicall,|
      block |Vntill thy base by oft subtilation,|
      block |Will lightly flowe as wax vpon mettall,|
      block |Then loose it with thy vegetable menstruall,|
      block |Till thou haue oyle thereof in colour bright,|
      block |Then is that menstrue visible to sight.|
    block
      block |And oyle is drawne out in colour of golde,|
      block |Or like thereto out of fine red lead,|
      block |Which Raymond sayd when he was olde,|
      block |Much more than golde would stand in stead:|
      block |For when he was for age nigh dead,|
      block |He made thereof Aurum potabile,|
      block |Which him reuiued as men might see.|
    block
      block |For so together may they be circulate,|
      block |That is the base oyle and the vegetable menstruall,|
      block |So that it be by labour exuberate,|
      block |And made by craft a stone celestiall,|
      block |Of nature so firie that we it call,|
      block |Our Bazeliske or our Cockatrice,|
      block |Our great Elixer most of price.|
    block
      block |Which as the sight of Bazeliske his obiect|
      block |Killeth, so sleyeth it crude Mercurie,|
      block |When thereupon he is proiect,|
      block |In twinckle of an eye most sodainly,|
      block |That Mercurie then teineth permanently,|
      block |All bodies to Sunne and Moone perfect,|
      block |Thus guide thy base both red and white.|
    block
      block |Aurum potabile thus is made,|
      block |Of golde not commonly calcinate,|
      block |But of our tincture that will not fade,|
      block |Out of our base drawn with the menstrue circulate▪|
      block |But naturall calcination must algate|
      block |Be made, ere thy golde dissolued may bee,|
      block |That principle first therefore I will teach thee.|
    block
      block |But into chapters this Treatise I will diuide,|
      block |In number twelue with due recapitulation;|
      block |Superfluous rehearsalls Ile lay aside,|
      block |Intending onely to giue true information,|
      block |Both of theorick and practick operation:|
      block |That by my writing whoso guided will bee,|
      block |Of his intent perfectly speede shall hee.|
    block
      block |The first chapter shall be of naturall Calcination,|
      block |The second of Dissolution secreat and Philosophicall,|
      block |The third of our elementall Separation,|
      block |The fourth of Coniunction matrimoniall,|
      block |The fift of Putrifaction follow shall,|
      block |Of Congelation albificate shalbe the sixt,|
      block |Then of Cibation the seauenth shall follow next.|
    block
      block |The secret of Sublimation the eight shall show;|
      block |The ninth shall be of firmentation;|
      block |The tenth of our exaltation I trow;|
      block |The eleuenth of our meruailous multiplication;|
      block |The twelfth of proiection, then recapitulation:|
      block |And so this treatize shall take an end,|
      block |By the helpe of God as I intend.|

  block |Of Calcination. The first Gate.|
    block
      block |CAlcination is the purgation of our stone,|
      block |Restoring also of his naturall heate,|
      block |Of radicall humiditie it looseth none,|
      block |Inducing solution into our stone most meete,|
      block |After philosophie I you behight|
      block |Doo, but not after the common guise,|
      block |With Sulphures or Salts preparate in diuers wise.|
    block
      block |Neither with Corosiues nor with fire alone,|
      block |Neither with vineger nor with water ardent,|
      block |Nor with the vapour of leade our stone|
      block |Is calcined according to our intent:|
      block |All those to calcining which so be bent,|
      block |From this hard science withdrawe their hand,|
      block |Till they our calcining better vnderstand.|
    block
      block |For by such calcination their bodies be shent,|
      block |Which minisheth the moysture of our stone:|
      block |Therefore when bodies to powder be brent,|
      block |Dry as ashes of tree or bone,|
      block |Of such calxes then will we none;|
      block |For moysture we multiplie radicall,|
      block |In calcining minishing none at all.|
    block
      block |And for a sure ground of our true calcination,|
      block |Worke wittely only kind with kind:|
      block |For kind vnto kind hath appetitiue inclination,|
      block |Who knoweth not this in knowledge is blind,|
      block |He may foorth wander as mist in the wind,|
      block |Wotting neuer with profite where to light,|
      block |Because he conceaues not our words aright.|
    block
      block |Ioyne kind to kind therefore as reason is,|
      block |For euery burgeon answers his owne seede,|
      block |Man getteth man, a beast a beast I wis,|
      block |Further to treate of this it is no neede.|
      block |But vnderstand this poynt if thou wilt speede,|
      block |Each thing is first calcined in his owne kind;|
      block |This well conceaued fruite therein shalt thou finde.|
    block
      block |And we make Calx vnctuous both white and red|
      block |Of three degrees or our base be perfect,|
      block |Fluxible as waxe, els stand they in no sted.|
      block |By right long processe as Philosophers doo write,|
      block |A yeare we take or more to our respite:|
      block |For in lesse space our Calxes will not be made,|
      block |Able to teyne with colour that will not fade.|
    block
      block |And for thy proportion thou must beware,|
      block |For therein maist thou be beguil'd,|
      block |Therefore thy work that thou not mare,|
      block |Let thy bodie be subtilly fyl'de|
      block |With Mercury as much then so subtil'd,|
      block |One of the Sunne, two of the Moone,|
      block |Till altogether like papp be doone.|
    block
      block |Then make the Mercurie foure to the Sun▪|
      block |Two to the Moone as it should bee,|
      block |And thus thy worke must be begun,|
      block |In figure of the Trinitee,|
      block |Three of the bodie and of the spirite three,|
      block |And for the vnitie of the substance spirituall|
      block |One moe than of the substance corporall.|
    block
      block |By Raymonds reportory this is true,|
      block |Proportion there who list to looke,|
      block |The same my Doctor to me did shew,|
      block |But three of the spirite Bacon tooke,|
      block |To one of the bodie for which I a wooke,|
      block |Many a night ere I it wist.|
      block |And both be true take which you list.|
    block
      block |If the water also be equall in proportion|
      block |To the earth, with heate in due measure,|
      block |Of them shall spring a new burgeon,|
      block |Both white and red in pure tincture,|
      block |Which in the fire shall euer indure,|
      block |Kill thou the quick the dead reuiue;|
      block |Make trinitie vnitie without any striue.|
    block
      block |This is the surest and best proportion,|
      block |For there is least of the part spirituall,|
      block |The better therefore shall be solution,|
      block |Than if thou did it with water swall,|
      block |Thine earth ouer glutting which loseth all|
      block |Take heede therefore to potters loame,|
      block |And make thou neuer too neshe thy wombe.|
    block
      block |That loame beholde how it tempred is,|
      block |The meane also how it is calcinate,|
      block |And euer in minde looke thou beare this;|
      block |That neuer thine earth with water be suffocate,|
      block |Drye vp thy moysture with heate most temperate,|
      block |Help Dissolution with moysture of the Moone,|
      block |And Congelation with the Sunne, then hast thou doone.|
    block
      block |Foure Natures into the fift so shalt thou turne,|
      block |Which is a Nature most perfect and temperate,|
      block |But hard it is with thy bare foote to spurne|
      block |Against a barr of yron, or steele new acuate,|
      block |For many doe so which be infatuate,|
      block |When they such high things take in hand,|
      block |Which they in no wise doe vnderstand.|
    block
      block |In egges, in vitriall, or in blood,|
      block |What riches wend they there to finde,|
      block |If they Philosophy vnderstood,|
      block |They would not in working be so blinde;|
      block |Golde or siluer to seeke out of kinde:|
      block |For like as fire of burning principle is,|
      block |So is the principle of gilding gould I wis.|
    block
      block |If thou intend therefore for to make|
      block |Gold and Siluer by craft of our philosophie,|
      block |Thereto neyther egges nor bloud thou take|
      block |But Gold and Siluer which naturally|
      block |Calcined wisely and not manually,|
      block |A new generation will forth bring,|
      block |Encreasing their kinde as doth euery thing.|
    block
      block |And if it true were that profit might be|
      block |In things which be not mettaline,|
      block |In which be coulors pleasant to see,|
      block |As in bloud, eggs, haire, vrine. or wine,|
      block |Or in meane mineralls digd out of the myne,|
      block |Yet must that element be putrified and seperate,|
      block |And with Elements of perfect bodies be dispousate.|
    block
      block |But first of these elements make thou rotacion,|
      block |And into water thine earth turne first of all,|
      block |Then of thy water make ayre by leuigacion,|
      block |And ayre make fier, then Maister I will thee call|
      block |Of all our secrets great and small:|
      block |The wheele of Elements then canst thou turne about,|
      block |Truely conceiuing our writings without doubt.|
    block
      block |This done, goe backwards turning the wheele againe,|
      block |And into water turne thy fire anone,|
      block |Ayre into earth, els labourest thou in vaine,|
      block |For so to temperment is brought our stone,|
      block |And Natures contractions foure are made one,|
      block |After they haue three times been circulate,|
      block |And also thy base perfectly consumate.|
    block
      block |Thus vnder the moysture of the Moone,|
      block |And vnder the temperate heate of the Sunne,|
      block |Thine Elements shalbe incinerate soone,|
      block |And then thou hast the maistrie wonne:|
      block |Thanke God thy worke was then so begunne,|
      block |For there thou hast one token trewe,|
      block |Which first in blacknes to thee will shewe.|
    block
      block |The head of the Crowe that token call wee,|
      block |And some men call it the Crowes bill;|
      block |Some call it the ashes of Hermes tree,|
      block |And thus they name it after their will:|
      block |Our Toade of the earth which eateth his fill,|
      block |Some nameth it by which it is mortificate|
      block |The spirit with venome intoxicate.|
    block
      block |But it hath names I say to thee infinite,|
      block |For after each thing that blacknes is to sight,|
      block |Named it is till time it waxeth white,|
      block |Then hath it names of more delight,|
      block |After all things that been full white,|
      block |And the red likewise after the same,|
      block |Of all red things doth take the name.|
    block
      block |At the first gate now art thou in,|
      block |Of the Philosophers Castell where they dwell,|
      block |Proceede wisely that thou may winne|
      block |In at moe gates of that Castell,|
      block |Which Castell is round as any bell,|
      block |And gates it hath eleuen yet moe,|
      block |One is conquered, now to the second goe.|
    block
      block |The end of the first gate.|

  block |Of Dissolution. The second Gate.|
    block
      block |OF Dissolution now will I speake a word or two,|
      block |Which sheweth out what erst was hid frō sight,|
      block |And maketh intenuate things that were thicke also,|
      block |By vertue of our first menstrue cleare and bright,|
      block |In which our bodies eclipsed been of light,|
      block |And of their hard and drye compaction subtilate,|
      block |Into their owne first matter kindly retrogradate.|
    block
      block |One in gender they be, and in number two,|
      block |Whose Father is the Sunne, the Moone the Mother,|
      block |The Mouer is Mercurie, these and no moe|
      block |Be our Magnesia, our Adropp, and none other|
      block |Things here be, but onely sister and brother,|
      block |That is to meane agent and patient,|
      block |Sulphure and Mercury coessentiall to our intent.|
    block
      block |Betwixt these two equalitie contrarious,|
      block |Ingendred is a meane most marueilously,|
      block |Which is our Mercury and menstrue vnctuous,|
      block |Our secreat Sulphure working inuisibly,|
      block |More fiercely than fire burning the bodie,|
      block |Dissoluing the bodie into water minerall,|
      block |Which night for darknes in the North we doe call.|
    block
      block |But yet I trow thou vndestandst not vtterly,|
      block |The very secreat of the Philosophers Dissolution,|
      block |Therefore conceiue me I counsell thee wittily,|
      block |For the truth I will tell thee without delusion:|
      block |Our solution is cause of our Congelation;|
      block |For Dissolution on the one side corporall,|
      block |Causeth Congelation on the other side spirituall.|
    block
      block |And we dissolue into water which wetteth no hand,|
      block |For when the earth is integrately incinerate,|
      block |Then is the water congealed; this vnderstand|
      block |For the elements be so together concatenate,|
      block |That when the bodie is from his first forme alterate,|
      block |A new forme is induced immediatly,|
      block |For nothing being without all forme is vtterly.|
    block
      block |And heere a secret to thee I will disclose,|
      block |Which is the ground vnto our secrets all,|
      block |And it not knowne thou shalt but lose|
      block |Thy labour and costs both great and small,|
      block |Take heed therefore in error that thou not fall,|
      block |The more thine earth, and the lesse thy water be,|
      block |The rather and better solucion shalt thou see.|
    block
      block |Behold how yce to water doth relent,|
      block |And so it must for water it was before,|
      block |Right so againe to water our earth is went,|
      block |And water thereby congeald for euermore,|
      block |For after all Philosophers that euer were bore,|
      block |Each mettall was once water mynerall,|
      block |Therefore with water they turne to water all.|
    block
      block |In which water of kinde occasionate,|
      block |Of qualities been repugnant and diuersitie,|
      block |Things into things must therefore be rotate,|
      block |Vntill diuersitie be brought to perfect vnitie:|
      block |For Scripture recordeth when the earth shall be|
      block |Troubled, and into the deepe Sea shall be cast,|
      block |Mountaines and bodies likewise at the last.|
    block
      block |Our bodies be likened conueniently|
      block |To mountaines, which after high Planets we name,|
      block |Into the deepnes therefore of Mercurie|
      block |Turne them, and keepe thee out of blame,|
      block |For then shalt thou see a noble game,|
      block |How all shall become powder as soft as silke,|
      block |So doth our rennit kindly kurd vp our milke.|
    block
      block |Then hath the bodies their first forme lost,|
      block |And others been induced immediatly,|
      block |Then hast thou well bestowed thy cost:|
      block |Whereas others vncunning must goe by,|
      block |Not knowing the secrets of our philosohie:|
      block |Yet one poynt more I must tell thee,|
      block |How each bodie hath dimensions three.|
    block
      block |Altitude, Latitude, and also profunditie,|
      block |By which all gates turne we must our wheele,|
      block |Knowing that thine entrance in the West shall be,|
      block |Thy passages forth to the North if thou doo weele,|
      block |And there thy lights lose their lights each deele;|
      block |For there thou must abide by ninetie nights|
      block |In darknes of purgatorie withouten lights.|
    block
      block |Then take thy course vp to the East anone,|
      block |By colours passing variable in manifold wise,|
      block |And then be winter and vere nigh ouergone,|
      block |To the East therefore thine ascending deuise,|
      block |For there the Sunne with daylight doth vprise|
      block |In sommer, and there disport thee with delight,|
      block |For there thy worke shall become perfect white.|
    block
      block |Foorth from the East into the South ascend,|
      block |And set thee downe there in the chaire of fire,|
      block |For there is haruest, that is to say an end|
      block |Of all this worke after thine owne desire,|
      block |There shineth the Sunne vp in his Hemisphere,|
      block |After the Eclipses in rednes with glorie,|
      block |As king to raigne vpon all mettals and Mercurie.|
    block
      block |And in one glasse must be done all this thing,|
      block |Like to an Egge in shape and closed weele,|
      block |Then must thou know the measure of firing,|
      block |The which vnknowne thy worke is lost each deele:|
      block |Let neuer thy glasse be hotter than thou maist feele|
      block |And suffer still in thy bare hand to hold,|
      block |For feare of losing, as Philosophers haue told.|
    block
      block |Yet to my doctrine furthermore attend,|
      block |Beware thy glasse thou neuer open ne meue|
      block |From the beginning till thou haue made an end;|
      block |If thou doo contrarie, thy worke may neuer cheue.|
      block |Thus in this Chapter which is but briefe,|
      block |I haue thee taught thy true solution:|
      block |Now to the third gate goe, for this is won.|
    block
      block |The end of the second gate.|

  block |Of Seperation. The third gate.|
    block
      block |SEperation doth each part from other diuide,|
      block |The subtile from the grosse, the thick frō the thinn|
      block |But Seperation manuall looke thou set a side,|
      block |For that pertaines to fooles that little good doth winn,|
      block |But in our Seperation Nature doth not blinn,|
      block |Making diuision of qualities elementall,|
      block |Into a fift degree till they be turned all.|
    block
      block |Earth is turned into water vnder black and bloe,|
      block |And water after into ayre vnder very white,|
      block |Then Aire into fire, elements there be no moe,|
      block |Of these is made our stone of great delight,|
      block |But of this Seperation much more must we write,|
      block |And Seperation is called by Philosophers definition,|
      block |Of the saide foure elements terraptatiue dispersion.|
    block
      block |Of this Seperation I finde a like figure,|
      block |Thus spoken by the Prophet in the Psalmodie,|
      block |God brought out of a stone a flood of water pure,|
      block |And out of the hardest rock oyle abundantly,|
      block |So out of our stone precious if thou be witty,|
      block |Oyle incombustable, and water thou shalt draw,|
      block |And there abouts at the coale thou needst not to blow.|
    block
      block |Doe this with heate easie and nourishing,|
      block |First with moyst fire and after that with drie,|
      block |The flegme with patience out drawing,|
      block |And after that the other Natures wittely|
      block |Drye vp thine earth vntill it be thirsty,|
      block |By Calcination else labourest thou in vaine,|
      block |And then make it drink vp the moysture againe.|
    block
      block |Seperation thus must thou oftetimes make,|
      block |Thy waters diuiding into partes two,|
      block |So that the subtile from the grosse thou take,|
      block |Till earth remaine beneath in colours bloe,|
      block |That earth is fixed to abide all woe,|
      block |The other parte is spirituall and flying,|
      block |But thou must turne them all into one thing.|
    block
      block |Then oyle and water with water shall distill,|
      block |And through her helpe receiue mouing,|
      block |Keepe well these two that thou not spill|
      block |Thy worke for lack of due closing,|
      block |And make thy stopple of glasse melting,|
      block |The topp of thy vessell together with it,|
      block |Then Philosopher-like it is vp shit.|
    block
      block |The water wherewith thou mayst reuiue the stone,|
      block |Looke thou distill before thou worke with it,|
      block |Oftentimes by it selfe alone,|
      block |And by this sight thou shalt wit,|
      block |From feculent feces when it is quit:|
      block |For some men can with Saturne it multiplie,|
      block |And other substance which we defie.|
    block
      block |Distill it therefore till it be clene|
      block |And thinne like water as it should be,|
      block |As heauen in colour bright and shene,|
      block |Keping both figure and ponderositee,|
      block |Therewith did Hermes moysten his tree:|
      block |Within his glasse he made it grow vpright,|
      block |With flowers discoloured beautifull to sight.|
    block
      block |This water is like to the venymous Tire,|
      block |Wherewith the mighty triacle is wrought,|
      block |For it is poyson most strong of Ire,|
      block |A stronger poyson cannot be thought,|
      block |At Pothecaries often therefore it is sought,|
      block |But no man by it shalbe intoxicate,|
      block |From the time it is into medicine elixerate.|
    block
      block |For then as is the Triacle true,|
      block |It is of poyson most expulsiue,|
      block |And in his working doth marueiles shew,|
      block |Preseruing many from death to life,|
      block |But looke thou meddle it with no corosiue,|
      block |But choose it pure and quick rinning,|
      block |If thou thereby wilt haue winning.|
    block
      block |It is a marueilous thing in kinde,|
      block |And without it can nothing be done,|
      block |Therefore Hermes called it his winde,|
      block |For it is vp flying from Sunne and Moone,|
      block |And maketh our stone flie with it soone,|
      block |Reuiuing the dead and giuing life,|
      block |To Sunne and Moone, husband and wife.|
    block
      block |Which if they were not by craft made quick,|
      block |And their fatnes with water drawne out,|
      block |And so the thinne disseuered from the thick,|
      block |Thou shouldst neuer bring this worke about:|
      block |If thou wilt therefore speede without doubt,|
      block |Rayse vp the birds out of their neast,|
      block |And after againe bring them to rest.|
    block
      block |Water with water accord will and ascend,|
      block |And spirit with spirit, for they be of one kinde,|
      block |Which after they be exalted make to discend,|
      block |So shalt thou deuide that, which Nature erst did binde,|
      block |Mercury essentiall turning into winde,|
      block |Without which naturall and subtill Seperation,|
      block |May neuer be complete profitable generation.|
    block
      block |Now to helpe thee in at this gate,|
      block |The last secreat I will declare to thee,|
      block |Thy water must be seauen times sublimate,|
      block |Else shall no kindly Dissolution bee,|
      block |Nor putrifying shalt thou none see;|
      block |Like liquid pitch, nor colours appearing|
      block |For lack of fire within the glasse working.|
    block
      block |Foure fires there be which thou must vnderstand,|
      block |Naturall, innaturall, against Nature also,|
      block |And elementall which doth burne the brand:|
      block |These foure fires vse we and no moe,|
      block |Fire against nature must doe thy bodie woe,|
      block |This is our Dragon as I thee tell,|
      block |Fiercely burning as the fire of hell.|
    block
      block |Fire of nature is the third menstruall,|
      block |That fire is naturall in each thing;|
      block |But fire occasionate, we call vnnaturall,|
      block |As heate of ashes, and balnes for putrifying:|
      block |Without these fires thou maist naught bring|
      block |To Putrifaction, for to be seperate,|
      block |Thy matters together proportionate.|
    block
      block |Therefore make fire thy glasse within,|
      block |Which burneth the bodie much more than fire|
      block |Elementall, if thou wilt winne|
      block |Our secrets according to thy desire:|
      block |Then shall thy seeds both rot and spire|
      block |By helpe of fire occasionate,|
      block |That kindly after they may be seperate.|
    block
      block |Of Seperation the Gate must thus be wonne,|
      block |That furthermore yet thou maist proceed|
      block |Towards the Gate of secret Coniunction,|
      block |Into the Castle which will thee inner leed:|
      block |Doe after my counsell if thou wilt speed,|
      block |With two strong lockes this Gate is shir,|
      block |As consequently thou shalt well wit.|
    block
      block |The end of the third Gate.|

  block |Of Coniunction. The fourth Gate.|
    block
      block |AFter the Chapiter of naturall Seperation,|
      block |By which the elemēts of our stone disseuered be,|
      block |The chapter here followeth of secret Coniunction,|
      block |Which Natures repugnant ioyneth to perfect vnitie,|
      block |And so them knitteth that none from others may flie,|
      block |When they by fire shalbe examinate,|
      block |They be togethers so surely coniungate.|
    block
      block |And therefore Philosophers giue this definition|
      block |Saying this Coniunction is nothing els|
      block |But of disseuered qualities a copulation,|
      block |Or of principles a coequation as others tells:|
      block |But some men with Mercurie that Pothecaries sells|
      block |Medleth bodies, which cannot diuide|
      block |Their matter, and therefore they slip aside.|
    block
      block |For vntill the time the soule be seperate|
      block |And cleansed from his originall sinne|
      block |With the water, and throughly spiritualizate,|
      block |The true Coniunction maist thou neuer begin:|
      block |Therefore the soule first from the bodie twyne,|
      block |Then of the corporall part and of the spirituall.|
      block |The soule shall cause coniunction perpetuall.|
    block
      block |Of two Coniunctions Philosophers mencion make,|
      block |Grosse when the bodie with Mercury is reincrudate▪|
      block |But let this passe, and to the second heede take,|
      block |Which as I saide is after Seperation celebrate,|
      block |In which the parties be left with least to colligate,|
      block |And so promoted vnto most perfect temperance,|
      block |That neuer after amongst them may be repugnance.|
    block
      block |Thus causeth Seperation true Coniunction to be had,|
      block |Of water and ayre, with earth and fire,|
      block |But that each element into other may be lad,|
      block |And so abide for euer to thy desire,|
      block |Doe as doe dawbers with clay or myre,|
      block |Temper them thick and make them not too thinne,|
      block |So doe vpdrying, thou shalt the rather winne.|
    block
      block |But manners there be of our Coniunction three,|
      block |The first is called by Philosophers Diptatiue,|
      block |The which betwixt the agent and patient must be,|
      block |Male and female, Mercury, and Sulphure viue,|
      block |Matter, and forme, thinne, and thick to thrine,|
      block |This lesson will helpe thee without any doubt,|
      block |And our Coniunction truly to bring about.|
    block
      block |The second manner is called Triptatiue,|
      block |Which is Coniunction, made of things three,|
      block |Of bodie, soule and spirit, that they not striue,|
      block |Which trinitie thou must bring to vnitee,|
      block |For as the soule to the spirite the bond must bee;|
      block |Right so the bodie the soule to him must knit,|
      block |Out of thy minde let not this lesson flit.|
    block
      block |The third manner and also the last of all,|
      block |Foure Elements together which ioyne to abide,|
      block |Tetraptatiue certainely Philosophers doe it call,|
      block |And specially Guido de Montano whose fame goeth wide,|
      block |And therefore in most laudable maner this tide,|
      block |In our Coniunction foure Elements must aggregate|
      block |In due proportion, which first a sunder were seperate.|
    block
      block |Therefore like as the woman hath veines fifteene,|
      block |And the man but fiue to the act of their secunditie,|
      block |Required in our Coniunction first I meene,|
      block |So must the man our Sunne haue of his water three,|
      block |And nine his wife, which three to him must bee:|
      block |Then like with like will ioy haue for to dwell,|
      block |More of Coniunction me needeth not to tell.|
    block
      block |This chapiter I will conclude right soone therefore,|
      block |Grosse Coniunction charging thee to make but one,|
      block |For seldome haue strumpets children of them ybore,|
      block |And so thou shalt neuer come by our stone,|
      block |Without thou let the woman lig alone,|
      block |That after she once haue conceiued of the man,|
      block |Her Matrix be shut vp from all other than.|
    block
      block |For such as adde euer more crude to crude,|
      block |Opening their vessell letting their matters keele,|
      block |The sparme conceiued they nourish not but delude|
      block |Themselues, and sp•ll their worke each deele,|
      block |If thou therefore haue lift to doe weele,|
      block |Close vp thy Matrix and nourish the seede,|
      block |With heat continual and temperate if thou wilt speed.|
    block
      block |And when thy vessell hath stood by moneths fiue,|
      block |And clowdes and Eclipses be passed each one,|
      block |The light appearing, encrease thy heate then beliue,|
      block |Vntill bright and shining in whitenes be thy Stone▪|
      block |Then maist thou open thy glasse anone,|
      block |And feede thy childe which is ybore,|
      block |With milke and meate ay more and more.|
    block
      block |For now both moist and drie is so contemperate,|
      block |That of the water earth hath receiued impression,|
      block |Which neuer (after that) asunder may be seperate;|
      block |And right so water to earth hath giuen ingression,|
      block |That both together to dwell haue made profession,|
      block |And water of earth hath purchased a retentiue,|
      block |They foure made one neuer more to striue.|
    block
      block |Thus in two things all our intent doth hing,|
      block |In drie and moist, which be contraries two▪|
      block |In drie, that it the moyst to flixing bring,|
      block |In moist, that it giue liquefaction to the earth also:|
      block |Then of them thus a temperment may foorth goe,|
      block |A temperment not so thicke as the bodie is,|
      block |Neither so thinne as water withouten mis.|
    block
      block |Loosing and knitting thereof be principles two|
      block |Of this hard science, and poles most principall;|
      block |Howbeit that other principles be many moe,|
      block |As shining fanes, which show I shall:|
      block |Proceede therefore vnto another wall|
      block |Of this strong Castle of our wisdome,|
      block |That in at the fift Gate thou maist come.|
    block
      block |The end of the fourth Gate.|

  block |Of Putrifaction. The fift Gate.|
    block
      block |NOw we begin the chapter of Putrifaction,|
      block |Without which pole no seed may multiply,|
      block |Which must be done only by continual action|
      block |Of heate in the bodie, moyst not manually:|
      block |For bodies els may not be altred naturally,|
      block |Sith Christ doth witnes, without the graine of wheate|
      block |Dye in the ground, encrease maist thou none get.|
    block
      block |And in likewise without the matter putrifie,|
      block |It may in no wise truly be alterate,|
      block |Neither thy Elements may be diuided kindly,|
      block |Nor the coniunction of them perfectly celebrate:|
      block |That thy labor therefore be not frustrate,|
      block |The priuitie of our putrifying well vnderstand,|
      block |Or euer thou take this worke in hand.|
    block
      block |And Putrifaction may thus defined bee|
      block |After Philosophers sayings, to be of bodies the sleying;|
      block |And in our Compound a diuision of things three,|
      block |The killed bodies into corruption foorth leading,|
      block |And after vnto regeneration them abling,|
      block |For things being in the earth, without doubt|
      block |Be engendred of rotation of the heauens about.|
    block
      block |And therefore like as I haue sayd before,|
      block |Thine Elements commixt and wisely coequate,|
      block |Thou keepe in temperate heate eschewing euermore,|
      block |That they by violent heat be not incinerate|
      block |To powder drye vnprofitably Rubificate,|
      block |But into powder black as a crowes bill,|
      block |With heate of Balne or else of our dunghill.|
    block
      block |Vntill the time that nights be passed ninetie,|
      block |In moyst heate keepe them for any thing.|
      block |Soone after by blacknes thou shalt espie|
      block |That they draw fast to putrifying,|
      block |Which thou shalt after many colours bring|
      block |To perfect whitenes by patience easily,|
      block |And so thy seede in his nature shall multiplie.|
    block
      block |Make each the other then to halfe and kisse,|
      block |And like as children to play them vp and downe▪|
      block |And when their shirts are filed with pisse,|
      block |Then let the woman to wash be bowne,|
      block |Which oft for faintnes will fall in a swowne,|
      block |And dye at the last with her children all,|
      block |And goe to purgatorie to purge their filth originall.|
    block
      block |When they be there, by little and little increase|
      block |Their paines, by heat, aye more and more,|
      block |The fire from them let neuer cease.|
      block |And so that thy furnace be surely apt therefore,|
      block |Which wise men call an Athenore,|
      block |Conseruing heat required most temperatelie,|
      block |By which thy matter doth kindly putrifie.|
    block
      block |Of this principle speaketh sapient Guido,|
      block |And sayth by rotting dyeth the compound corporall,|
      block |And then after Morien and other moe,|
      block |Vpriseth againe regenerate simple and spirituall,|
      block |And were not heate and moysture continuall,|
      block |Sparme in the wombe might haue none abiding,|
      block |And so there should no fruite thereof vpspring.|
    block
      block |Therefore at the beginning our stone thou take,|
      block |And burie each one in other within their graue,|
      block |Then equally betwixt them a marriage make,|
      block |To ligge together sixe weekes let them haue,|
      block |Their seede conceiued, kindly to nourish and saue,|
      block |From the ground of their graue not rising that while,|
      block |Which secreat point doth many a one beguile.|
    block
      block |This time of conception with easie heate abide,|
      block |The blacknes shewing shall tell thee when they dye,|
      block |For they togeather like liquid pitch that tide,|
      block |Shall swell and burble, settle and putrifie,|
      block |Shining colours therin thou shalt espie,|
      block |Like to the rainebow marueilous to sight,|
      block |The Water then beginneth to drye vpright.|
    block
      block |For in moyst bodies heate working temperate,|
      block |Ingendreth blacknes, first of all which is,|
      block |Of kindly Coniunction the token assignate,|
      block |And of true putrifying: remember this,|
      block |For then perfectly to alter thou canst not misse,|
      block |And thus by the gate of blacknes thou must come in,|
      block |The light of Paradice in whitenes if thou wilt win.|
    block
      block |For first the Sunne in his vprising obscurate|
      block |Shalbe, and passe the waters of Noes flood,|
      block |On earth which was an hundreth dayes continuate|
      block |And fiftie, away ere all these waters yood;|
      block |Right so our waters (as wisemen vnderstood)|
      block |Shall passe, that thou with Dauid may say,|
      block |Abierunt in sicco flumina: beare this away.|
    block
      block |Soone after that Noah planted his vineyard,|
      block |Which royally flourished, and brought foorth grapes anone,|
      block |After which space thou shalt not be afeard,|
      block |For in likewise shal follow the flourishing of our stone:|
      block |And soone after that xxx. dayes be gone,|
      block |Thou shalt haue grapes right as Rubie read,|
      block |Which is our Adropp, our Vcifer, and our red lead.|
    block
      block |For like as soules after paines transitorie|
      block |Be brought to Paradice, where euer is ioyfull life;|
      block |So shall our Stone (after his darknes in Purgatorie)|
      block |Be purged, and ioyned in Elements withouten strife,|
      block |Reioyce the whitenes and beautie of his wife,|
      block |And passe from darknes of purgatorie to light|
      block |Of Paradice, in whitenes Elixer of great might.|
    block
      block |And that thou maist the rather to Putrifaction win,|
      block |This example thou take to thee for a true conclusion,|
      block |For all the secret of Putrifaction resteth therein;|
      block |The hart of oke that hath of water continuall infusion|
      block |Will not soone putrifie, I tell thee without delusion:|
      block |For though it in water lay 100. yeares and more.|
      block |Yet shouldst thou finde it sound as ere it was before.|
    block
      block |But and thou keepe it sometime wet & sometime drie,|
      block |As thou maist see in timber by vsuall experiment,|
      block |By processe of time that oke shall putrifie;|
      block |And so euen likewise according to our intent,|
      block |Sometime our tree must with the Sunne be brent,|
      block |And then with water we must it keele,|
      block |That by this meanes to rotting we may bring it weele.|
    block
      block |For now in wet, and now againe in drie,|
      block |And now in heate, and now againe in colde|
      block |To be, shall cause it soone to putrifie,|
      block |And so shalt thou bring to rotting thy golde:|
      block |Intreate thy bodies as I haue thee tolde,|
      block |And in thy putrifying, with heate be not too swift,|
      block |Least in the ashes thou seeke after thy thrift.|
    block
      block |Therefore thy water out of the earth thou drawe,|
      block |And make the soule therewith for to ascend;|
      block |Then downe againe into the earth it throwe,|
      block |That they oft times so ascend and descend:|
      block |From violent heate and sudden colde defend|
      block |Thy glasse, and make thy fire so temperate,|
      block |That by the sides the matter be not vitrificate.|
    block
      block |And be thou wise in choosing of the matter,|
      block |Meddle with no salts, sulphurs, nor meane mineralls:|
      block |For whatsoeuer any worker to thee doth clatter,|
      block |Our Sulphur and our Mercury been onely in metttalls,|
      block |Which oyles and waters some men them calls,|
      block |Foules and birds, with other names many one,|
      block |Because that fooles should neuer know our stone.|
    block
      block |For of this world our stone is called the sement|
      block |Which moued by craft as nature doth require,|
      block |In his encrease shall be full opulent,|
      block |And multiply his kinde after thine owne desire,|
      block |Therefore if God vouchsafe thee to inspire,|
      block |To know the truth, and fansies to eschew|
      block |Like vnto thee in riches shall be but few.|
    block
      block |But many men be moou'd to worke after their fantasie,|
      block |In many subiects in which be tinctures gay:|
      block |Both white and red diuided manually|
      block |To sight, but in the fire they flyeaway:|
      block |Such breake pottes and glasses day by day,|
      block |Enpoysoning themselues and loosing their sights,|
      block |With odours, smoakes, and watching vp by nights.|
    block
      block |Their clothes be baudy and worne thread bare,|
      block |Men may them smell for multipliers where they goe,|
      block |To file their fingers with corosiues they doo not spare,|
      block |Their eyes be bleard, their cheekes leane and blowe,|
      block |And thus for had I wist they suffer losse and woe:|
      block |And such when they haue lost that was in their purse,|
      block |Then doo they chide, and Philosophers sore doo curse.|
    block
      block |To see their houses it is a noble sport,|
      block |What furnaces, what glasses there be of diuers shapes,|
      block |What salts, what powders, what oyles, waters fort,|
      block |How eloquently de Materia prima their tungs do clap,|
      block |And yet to finde the truthe they haue no hap;|
      block |Of our Mercurie they meddle & of our sulphure viue,|
      block |Wherein they dote, and more and more vnthriue.|
    block
      block |For all the while they haue Philosophers bene,|
      block |Yet could they neuer know what was our Stone,|
      block |Some sought it in dung, in vrine, some in wine,|
      block |Some in starre slyme (for thing it is but one),|
      block |In blood, in egges: some till their thrift was gone,|
      block |Diuiding Elements, and breaking manie a pot,|
      block |Sheards multiplying, but yet they hit it not.|
    block
      block |They talke of the red man and of his white wife,|
      block |That is a speciall thing, and of the Elixers two,|
      block |Of the Quintessence, and of the Elixer of life,|
      block |Of honie, Celidonie, and of Secondines also,|
      block |These they diuide into Elements, with others moe;|
      block |No multipliers, but Philosophers called will they bee,|
      block |Which naturall Philosophie did neuer read nor see.|
    block
      block |This fellowship knoweth our Stone right weele,|
      block |They thinke them richer than is the King,|
      block |They will him help, he shall not faile|
      block |Fraunce for to winne a wondrous thing,|
      block |The holy Crosse home will they bring,|
      block |And if the King were prisoner ytake,|
      block |Right soone his raunsome would they make.|
    block
      block |A meruaile it is that Westminster Kerke,|
      block |To the which these Philosophers doo much haunt,|
      block |Since they can so much riches werke|
      block |As they make boast of and auaunt,|
      block |Drinking daylie at the wine a due taunt,|
      block |Is not made vp perfectly at once;|
      block |For truly it lacketh yet many stones.|
    block
      block |Fooles doo follow them at the taile,|
      block |Promoted to riches weening to bee;|
      block |But will you heare, what worship and auaile|
      block |They winne in London that noble Citie?|
      block |With siluer maces (as you may see)|
      block |Sergeants awaiteth on them each bowre,|
      block |So been they men of great honour.|
    block
      block |Sergeants seeke them from streete to streete,|
      block |Merchants and Goldsmiths lay after them watch,|
      block |That well is him that with them may meete,|
      block |For the great aduantage that they doe catch,|
      block |They hunt about as doth a bratch,|
      block |Weening to winne so great treasure,|
      block |That euer in riches they shall endure.|
    block
      block |Some would catch their goods againe,|
      block |And some more good would aduenture,|
      block |Some for to haue would be full faine|
      block |Of ten pounds one, I you ensure,|
      block |Some which haue lent without measure|
      block |Their goods, and be with pouertie clad,|
      block |To catch a noble, would be full glad.|
    block
      block |But when the Sergeants doth them arrest,|
      block |Their pautners be stuffed with Paris balls,|
      block |Or with signets of Saint Martins at the least;|
      block |But as for money it is pist against the walls:|
      block |Then be they led (as well for them befalls)|
      block |To Newgate or Ludgate as I you tell,|
      block |Because they shall in safegard dwell.|
    block
      block |Where is my money become, saith one?|
      block |And where is mine, saith he and he?|
      block |But will you heare how subtill they be anone|
      block |In answering, that they excused be?|
      block |Saying, of our Elixers robbed be we,|
      block |Else might we haue paid you all your golde,|
      block |Though it had been more by tenne folde.|
    block
      block |And then their Creditors they flatter so,|
      block |Promising to worke for them againe|
      block |In right short space the Elixers two,|
      block |Doting the Merchants that they be faine|
      block |To let them goe, but euer in vaine;|
      block |They worke so long, till at the last,|
      block |They be againe in prison cast.|
    block
      block |If any them aske, why they be not ritch?|
      block |They say they can make fine golde of tinne,|
      block |But he (say they) may surely swimme the ditch,|
      block |Which is vpholden by the chinne;|
      block |We haue no stock, therefore may we not winne,|
      block |Which if we had, we would soone werck|
      block |Inough to finish vp Westminster Kerck.|
    block
      block |And some of them be so deuout,|
      block |They will not dwell out of that place;|
      block |For there they may withouten doubt|
      block |Doe what them list to their solace,|
      block |The Archdeacon is so full of grace,|
      block |That if they blesse him with their crosse,|
      block |He forceth little of other mens losse.|
    block
      block |And when they there sit at the wine,|
      block |These Monkes they say haue manie a pound,|
      block |Would God (saith one) that some were mine.|
      block |Yet care away, let the cup goe round;|
      block |Drinke on saith another, the meane is found,|
      block |I am a maister of that Arte,|
      block |I warrant vs we shall haue part.|
    block
      block |Such causeth Monkes euill to doone,|
      block |To waste their wages through their dotage,|
      block |Some bringeth a mazer, and some a spoone,|
      block |Their Philosophers giueth them such comage,|
      block |Behighting them winning with domage,|
      block |A pound for a penie at the least againe;|
      block |And so faire promises make fooles faine.|
    block
      block |A royall medicine one vpon twelue,|
      block |They promise them thereof to haue,|
      block |Which they could neuer for them-selue|
      block |Yet bring about, so God me saue:|
      block |Beware such Philosophers no man depraue,|
      block |Which helpe these Monkes to riches so,|
      block |In thread bare coates that they must goe.|
    block
      block |The Abbot ought well to cherish this companie,|
      block |For they can teach his Monkes to liue in pouertie,|
      block |And to goe cloathed and moneyed religiouslie,|
      block |As did Saint Bennet, eschuing superfluitie,|
      block |Easing them also of the ponderositie|
      block |Of their purses, with pounds so aggrauate,|
      block |Which by Philosophie be now alleuiate.|
    block
      block |Lo who so medleth with this rich companie,|
      block |Great boast of their winning they may make:|
      block |For they shall reape as much by their Philosophie,|
      block |As they of the taile of an ape, can take:|
      block |Beware therefore for Iesus sake,|
      block |And meddle with nothing of great cost,|
      block |For if thou doe, it is but lost.|
    block
      block |These Philosophers (of which I spake before)|
      block |Meddle and blunder with manie a thing,|
      block |Running in errours euer more and more,|
      block |For lacke of true vnderstanding:|
      block |But like must like alwaies forth bring,|
      block |So hath God ordained in euerie kinde;|
      block |Would Iesus they would beare this in minde.|
    block
      block |Weene they of a Nettle to haue a Rose,|
      block |Or of an Elder to haue an apple sweete:|
      block |Alas, that wisemen their goods should lose,|
      block |Trusting such lorrells when they them meete,|
      block |Which say our Stone is troden vnder feete,|
      block |And maketh them vile things to distill,|
      block |Till all their howses with stench they fill.|
    block
      block |Some of them neuer learned a word in Schooles,|
      block |Should such by reason vnderstand Philosophie?|
      block |Be they Philosophers? Nay, they be fooles:|
      block |For their workes proue them vnwittie,|
      block |Meddle not with them, if thou be happie;|
      block |Least with their flatterie they so thee till,|
      block |That thou agree vnto their will.|
    block
      block |Spend not thy money away in waste,|
      block |Giue not to euery spirit credence,|
      block |But first examine, groape, and taste;|
      block |And as thou proouest, so put thy confidence,|
      block |But euer beware of great expence:|
      block |And if the Philosopher doe liue vertuouslie,|
      block |The better thou maist trust his Philosophie.|
    block
      block |Prooue him first, and him appose|
      block |Of all the secrets of our Stone;|
      block |Which if he knowe not, thou need not to lose,|
      block |Meddle thou no further, but let him gone,|
      block |Make he neuer so piteous a mone;|
      block |For then the Fox can fagge and faine,|
      block |When he would to his pray attaine.|
    block
      block |If he can answere as a Clarke,|
      block |Howbeit he hath not prooued it indeed,|
      block |And thou then help him to his warke;|
      block |If he be vertuous I hold it meed,|
      block |For he will thee quite if euer he speed,|
      block |And thou shalt knowe by a little anone,|
      block |If he haue knowledge of our Stone.|
    block
      block |One thing, one glasse, one furnace, and no moe,|
      block |Behold this principle if he doe take,|
      block |And if he doe not, then let him goe,|
      block |For he shall neuer thee rich man make;|
      block |Timely it is better thou him forsake,|
      block |Than after with losse and variance,|
      block |And other manner of displeasance.|
    block
      block |But if God fortune thee to haue|
      block |This Science by doctrine which I haue told,|
      block |Discouer it not whosoeuer it craue,|
      block |For fauour, feare, siluer, or gold;|
      block |Be no oppressor, letcher nor boaster bold:|
      block |Serue thy God, and help the poore among,|
      block |If thou this life lift to continue long.|
    block
      block |Vnto thy selfe thy secrets euer keepe|
      block |From sinners, which haue not God in dread,|
      block |But will thee cast in prison deepe,|
      block |Till thou them teach to doe it indeed,|
      block |Then slaunder on thee shall spring and spread,|
      block |That thou doest coyne then will they say,|
      block |And so vndoe thee for euer and aye.|
    block
      block |And if thou teach them this cunning,|
      block |Their sinfull liuing for to maintaine,|
      block |In hell therefore shalbe thy woonning,|
      block |For God of thee and them will take disdaine:|
      block |As thou nought couldst therefore thee faine,|
      block |That bodie and soule thou maist both saue,|
      block |And here in peace thy liuing to haue.|
    block
      block |Now in this Chapter I haue thee taught,|
      block |How thou thy bodies must putrifie,|
      block |And so to guide thee that thou be not caught,|
      block |And put to durance losse or villanie|
      block |My doctrine therefore remember wittely,|
      block |And passe forth towards the sixt Gate,|
      block |For thus the fift is triumphate.|
    block
      block |The end of the fift Gate.|

  block |Of Congelation. The sixt Gate.|
    block
      block |OF Congelation I need not much to write:|
      block |But what it is, I will to thee declare;|
      block |It is of soft things induration of colour white,|
      block |And confixation of spirits which flying are;|
      block |How to congeale, he needeth not much to care,|
      block |For Elements will knit together soone,|
      block |So that Putrifaction be kindly doone.|
    block
      block |But Congelations be made in diuers wise,|
      block |Of spirits and bodies dissolued to water cleare,|
      block |Of salts also dissolued twice or thrise,|
      block |And then congeald into a fluxible matter;|
      block |Of such congealing, fooles fast doo clatter,|
      block |And some dissolueth diuiding manuallie|
      block |Elements them after congealing to powder drie.|
    block
      block |But such congealing is not to our desire,|
      block |For vnto ours it is contrarious,|
      block |Our congelation dreadeth not the fire:|
      block |For it must euer stand in it vnctuous,|
      block |And it is also a tincture so bounteous,|
      block |Which in the aire congealed will not relent|
      block |To water, for then our worke were shent.|
    block
      block |Moreouer congeale not into so hard a stone|
      block |As glasse or christall, which melteth by fusion,|
      block |But so that it like waxe will melt anone|
      block |Withouten blast: and beware of delusion,|
      block |For such congealing accordeth not to our conclusion|
      block |As will not flowe, but runne to water againe|
      block |Like salt congealed, then labourest thou in vaine.|
    block
      block |Which congelation auaileth vs not a deale,|
      block |It longeth to multipliers, congealing vulgarly:|
      block |If thou therefore list to doe weele|
      block |(Sith the medicine shall neuer flowe kindly,|
      block |Neither congeale, without thou first it putrifie)|
      block |First purge, and then fixe the elements of our stone,|
      block |Till they together congeale and flowe anone.|
    block
      block |For when thy matter is made perfectly white,|
      block |Then will the spirit with the bodie congealed be:|
      block |But of that time thou maist haue long respite|
      block |Or it congeale like pearles in sight to thee,|
      block |Such congel••••n be thou glad to see,|
      block |And after lik• graines red as blood,|
      block |Richer than any worldly good.|
    block
      block |The earthly grosenes therefore first mortified,|
      block |In moysture blacknes ingendred is;|
      block |This principle may not be denied,|
      block |For naturall Philosophers so sayne ywis:|
      block |Which had, of whitenes thou maist not mis;|
      block |And into whitenes if thou congeale it once,|
      block |Then hast thou a stone most precious of all stones.|
    block
      block |And by the drie like as the moist did putrifie,|
      block |Which caused in colour blacknes to appeare,|
      block |Right so the moyst congealed by the drie,|
      block |Ingendreth whitenes shining by night full cleare,|
      block |And drines proceedeth as whiteth the matter,|
      block |Like as in blacknes moysture doth him shew|
      block |By colours variant alwayes new and new.|
    block
      block |The cause of all this is heate most temperate,|
      block |Working and mouing the matter continually,|
      block |And thereby also the matter is alterate,|
      block |Both inward and outward substantially,|
      block |Not as doo fooles to sight sophistically:|
      block |But in euerie part all fire to endure,|
      block |Fluxible, fixt, and stable in tincture.|
    block
      block |As Phisicke determineth of each digestion,|
      block |First done in the stomach in which is drines,|
      block |Causing whitenes without question,|
      block |Like as the second digestion causeth rednes,|
      block |Complete in the liuer by heate in temperatenes,|
      block |Right so our Stone by drines and by heate|
      block |Digested is to white and red compleate.|
    block
      block |But here thou must another secret knowe,|
      block |How the Philosophers childe in the ayre is borne,|
      block |Busie thee not too fast at the coale to blowe,|
      block |And take this neither for mocke nor scorne,|
      block |But trust me truly, else is all thy worke forlorne,|
      block |Without thine earth with water reuiued bee,|
      block |Our true congealing shalt thou neuer see.|
    block
      block |A soule it is betwixt heauen and earth being,|
      block |Arising from the earth as ayre with water pure,|
      block |And causing life in euerie liuely thing,|
      block |Incessable running vpon our foure folde nature,|
      block |Enforcing to better him with all his cure,|
      block |Which ayre is the fire of our Philosophie,|
      block |Named now oyle, now water mysticallie.|
    block
      block |And this meane ayre which oyle or water we call,|
      block |Our fire, our oyntment, our spirit, and our Stone,|
      block |In which one thing we ground our wisedomes all,|
      block |Goeth neither in nor out alone,|
      block |Nor the fire but the water anone:|
      block |First it out leadeth, and after it bringeth it in,|
      block |As water with water which will not lightly twin.|
    block
      block |And so may water only our water meeue,|
      block |Which mouing causeth both death and life|
      block |And water to water doth kindly cleeue|
      block |Without repugnance or anie strife,|
      block |Which water to fooles is nothing rife,|
      block |Being of the kinde withouten doubt|
      block |Of the spirit, called water and leader out.|
    block
      block |And water is the secret and life of euery thing,|
      block |That is of substance in this world yfound,|
      block |For of water each thing hath his beginning,|
      block |As showeth in women when they shalbe vnbound|
      block |By water, which passeth before if all be sound,|
      block |Called Albien, first from them running,|
      block |With greeuous throwes before their childing.|
    block
      block |And truly that is the cause most principall|
      block |Why Philosophers charge vs to be patient,|
      block |Till time the water be dried to powder all|
      block |With nourishing heate, continuall, not violent:|
      block |For qualities be contrarious of euerie element,|
      block |Till after blacke in white be made an vnion|
      block |Of them for euer, congeald without diuision.|
    block
      block |And furthermore, the preparation of this conuersion:|
      block |From thing to thing, from one state to another,|
      block |Is done onely by kindly and discreete operation|
      block |Of Nature, as is of sperme within the mother;|
      block |For sperme and heate, are as sister and brother,|
      block |Which be conuerted in themselues as nature can,|
      block |By action and passion at last to perfect man:|
    block
      block |For as the bodily part by nature was combyn•te|
      block |Into man, is such as the beginner was▪|
      block |Which though it thus frō thing to thing was alterate|
      block |Not out of kinde, to mixe with other kinde did passe,|
      block |And so our matter spermaticall within our glasse,|
      block |Within it selfe must turne from thing to thing▪|
      block |By heate most temperate only it nourishing.|
    block
      block |An other example naturall I may thee tell,|
      block |How the substance of an egge by nature is wrought|
      block |Into a Chicken not passing out of the shell,|
      block |A plainer example could I not haue thought,|
      block |And their conuersions be made till forth be brought|
      block |From state to state, the like by like in kinde,|
      block |With nourishing heate: onely beare this in minde.|
    block
      block |Another example here also thou maist read|
      block |Of vegetable things, taking consideration,|
      block |How euerie thing groweth of his owne seede|
      block |Through heate and moysture, by naturall operation;|
      block |And therfore myneralls be nourished by ministration|
      block |Of moysture radicall, which there beginning was,|
      block |Not passing their kinde within one glas.|
    block
      block |There we them turne from thing to thing againe,|
      block |Into their mother the water when they goe:|
      block |Which principle vnknowen, thou labourest in vaine.|
      block |Then all is sperme; and things there be no moe|
      block |But kinde with kinde in number two,|
      block |Male and female, agent and patient,|
      block |Within the matrix of the earth most orient.|
    block
      block |And these be turned by heate from thing to thing|
      block |Within one glasse, and so from state to state,|
      block |Vntill the time that nature doth them bring|
      block |Into one substance of the water regenerate:|
      block |And so the sperme with his kinde is alterate,|
      block |Able in likenes his kinde to multiply,|
      block |As doth in kinde all other things naturally.|
    block
      block |In the time of this said proces naturall,|
      block |While that the sperme conceiued is growing,|
      block |The substance is nourished with his owne menstruall,|
      block |Which water only out of the earth did spring,|
      block |Whose colour is greene in the first showing:|
      block |And from that time the Sunne hid•th his light,|
      block |Taking his course throughout the North by night.|
    block
      block |The sayd menstruall is (I say to thee in counsell)|
      block |The blood of our greene Lyon and not of vitriall▪|
      block |Dame Venus can the troth of this thee tell,|
      block |At the beginning, to counsell if thou her call,|
      block |This secret is hid by Philosophers great and small,|
      block |Which blood drawne out of the greene Lyon,|
      block |For lack of heate had not perfect digestion.|
    block
      block |But this blood called our secreat menstruall,|
      block |Wherewith our sperme is nourished temperately,|
      block |When it is turned into the feces corporall,|
      block |And so become white perfectly and very drye,|
      block |Congeald and fixed into his owne bodie,|
      block |Then biscoct blood to sight it may well seeme,|
      block |Of this worke named the milke white Dyademe.|
    block
      block |Vnderstand now that our firie water thus acuate,|
      block |Is called our menstruall water, wherein|
      block |Our earth is loosed and naturally calcinate,|
      block |By Congelation that they may neuer twinne,|
      block |But yet to congeale more water thou may not linne:|
      block |Into three partes of the acuate water sayd afore,|
      block |With the fourth parte of the earth congealed and no more.|
    block
      block |Vnto that substance therefore so congelate,|
      block |The fourth parte put of water christaline,|
      block |And make them then together to be dispousate,|
      block |By Congelation into a miner metaline,|
      block |Which like a sworde new slipped will shine,|
      block |After the blacknes which first will shew,|
      block |The fourth parte then giue it of water new.|
    block
      block |Imbibitions many it must haue yet,|
      block |Giue it the second, and after the third also.|
      block |The sayd proportion keeping in thy witt,|
      block |Then to another the fourth time looke thou goe,|
      block |The fift time and the sixt passe not therefore,|
      block |But put two partes at each time of them three,|
      block |And at the seuenth time fiue partes must there bee.|
    block
      block |When thou hast made seauen times Imbibition,|
      block |Againe then must thou turne about thy wheele,|
      block |And putrifie all that matter without addition,|
      block |First blacknes abiding if thou wilt doe weele,|
      block |Then into whitenes congeale it vp each deele,|
      block |And after by rednes into the south ascend,|
      block |Then hast thou brought thy base vnto an end.|
    block
      block |Thus is thy water then diuided into partes two,|
      block |With the first parte the bodies be putrificate,|
      block |And to thine Imbibitions the second parte must goe,|
      block |With which thy matter is afterwarde demigrate,|
      block |And soone vpon easie decoction albificate,|
      block |Then is it named by Philosophers out starry stone,|
      block |Bring that to rednes then is the sixt gate wonne.|
    block
      block |The end of the sixt gate.|

  block |Of Cibation. The seuenth Gate.|
    block
      block |NOw of Cibation I turne my pen to write,|
      block |Sith it must here the seuenth place occupie:|
      block |But in few words it wilbe expedite,|
      block |Take heede therefore, and vnderstand me wittelie;|
      block |Cibation is called a feeding of our matter drie,|
      block |With milke and meate, which moderately thou doe,|
      block |Vntill it be brought the third order vnto.|
    block
      block |But giue it neuer so much, that thou it glut;|
      block |Beware of dropsey, and also of Noahs flood:|
      block |By little and little therefore thou to it put|
      block |Of meate and drinke, as seemes to doo it good,|
      block |That watry humours not ouergrow the blood,|
      block |To drinke therefore let it be measured so,|
      block |That kindly appetite thou neuer quench it fro.|
    block
      block |For if it drinke too much, then must it haue|
      block |A vomit or els it wilbe sick too long,|
      block |From the dropsie therefore thy wombe thou saue,|
      block |And from the fl•x, or els it wilbe wrong,|
      block |But rather let it thirst for drinke among,|
      block |Than thou shouldst giue it ouermuch at once.|
      block |Which must in youth be dieted for the nonce.|
    block
      block |And if thou diet it (as nature doth require)|
      block |Moderately, till time that it be growen to age,|
      block |From colde it keeping, and nourishing with moyst fire,|
      block |Then shall it growe, and wexe full of courage,|
      block |And doe to thee both pleasure and aduantage:|
      block |For he shall make darke bodies whole and bright,|
      block |Clensing their leprosies through his might.|
    block
      block |Three times must thou turne about thy wheele,|
      block |Still keeping the rule of the said Cibation,|
      block |And then as soone as it the fire doth feele,|
      block |Like waxe it wilbe readie vnto liquation:|
      block |This chapter needeth no longer protestation,|
      block |For I haue tolde thee the dietorie most conuenient,|
      block |After thine Elements be made equipolent.|
    block
      block |And also how to whitenes thou shalt bring thy golde,|
      block |Most like in figure to leaues of hawthorne tree|
      block |Called Magnesia, afore as I haue tolde,|
      block |And our white Sulphure without combustibilitie,|
      block |Which from the fire away will neuer flie.|
      block |And thus the seuenth Gate (as you desired)|
      block |In the vprising of the Sunne is conquered.|
    block
      block |The end of the seuenth Gate.|

  block |Of Sublimation. The eight Gate.|
    block
      block |HEre of our Sublimation a word or two|
      block |I haue to speake, which the eight Gate is.|
      block |Fooles doo sublime, but sublime thou not so,|
      block |For we sublime not as they doe ywis:|
      block |To sublime truly therefore thou shalt not mis,|
      block |If thou canst make thy bodies first spirituall,|
      block |And then thy spirits (as I haue taught thee) corporall.|
    block
      block |Some doe Mercurie from vitrioll and salt sublime,|
      block |And other spirits from scales of yron and steele,|
      block |From egg-shels calcined, and from quick lime,|
      block |And in their manner yet sublime they right weele:|
      block |But such subliming accordeth neuer a deele|
      block |To our intents, for we sublime not so,|
      block |To true subliming therefore, now will I goe.|
    block
      block |In Sublimation first beware of one thing,|
      block |That thou sublime to the top of the vessell:|
      block |For without violence thou shalt it not downe bring|
      block |Againe, but there it will abide and dwell,|
      block |So it reioyceth with refrigeration I thee tell,|
      block |Keepe it therefore with temperate heate adowne|
      block |Full fortie dayes, till it wexe blacke and browne.|
    block
      block |For then the soule beginneth to come out|
      block |From his owne veynes, for all that subtill is|
      block |Will with the spirite ascend withouten doubt,|
      block |Beare in thy minde therefore, and thinke on this,|
      block |How here eclipsed been thy bodies,|
      block |As they doe putrifie subliming more and more|
      block |Into water, vntill they be all vp ybore.|
    block
      block |And thus their venome when they haue spued out|
      block |Into the water then blacke it doth appeare,|
      block |Becomming spirituall each deale without doubt,|
      block |Subliming easilie in our manner,|
      block |Into the water, which doth him beare:|
      block |For in the ayre our childe must thus be bore|
      block |Of the water againe, as I haue said before.|
    block
      block |But when these two by Sublimation continuall|
      block |Be laboured so with heate both moyst and temperate,|
      block |That all is white and purely made spirituall,|
      block |Then heauen vpon earth must be reiterate|
      block |Vntill the soule with the bodie be incorporate|
      block |That earth become all that before was heauen,|
      block |Which wilbe done in Sublimations seauen.|
    block
      block |And Sublimations we make for causes three,|
      block |The first cause is, to make the bodie spirituall;|
      block |The second is, that the spirite may corpora•l bee,|
      block |And become fixt with it, and consubstantiall;|
      block |The third cause is, that from his filthie originall|
      block |He may be cleansed, and his saltnes sulphurious|
      block |May be minished in him, which is infectious.|
    block
      block |Then when they thus together depured be,|
      block |They will sublime vp whiter than the snowe▪|
      block |That sight will greatly comfort thee:|
      block |For then anon perfectly thou shalt knowe|
      block |The spirits shall so adowne ythrowe,|
      block |That this eight Gate shalbe to thee vnlocked,|
      block |Out of the which many be shut and mocked.|
    block
      block |The end of the eight Gate.|

  block |Of Firmentation. The ninth Gate.|
    block
      block |TRue Firmentation few Workers vnderstand,|
      block |That secret therefore I will expound to thee,|
      block |I trauailed truly through manie a Land,|
      block |Ere euer I might finde any that would tell it mee:|
      block |Yet as God would, euermore blessed be hee,|
      block |At the last I came to the knowledge thereof perfite,|
      block |Take heede therefore what I thereof doe write.|
    block
      block |Firmentations in diuers manners be doone,|
      block |By which our medicine must be perpetuate|
      block |Into cleere water: some looseth Sunne and Moone,|
      block |And with their medicines make them to be congelate;|
      block |Which in the fire when they be examinate|
      block |May not abide, nor alter with complement:|
      block |For such Firmenting is not to our intent.|
    block
      block |But yet more kindly some other men doone,|
      block |Fermenting their medicines in this wise,|
      block |In Mercurie dissoluing both Sunne and Moone,|
      block |Till time with the spirit they will arise,|
      block |Subliming them together twice or thrice;|
      block |Then Fermentation therewith they make:|
      block |That is a way, but yet we it forsake.|
    block
      block |Some other there be which haue more hap,|
      block |To touch the troth in part of fermenting,|
      block |They amalgame their bodies with Mercurie like pap,|
      block |Then therevpon their medicines relenting:|
      block |These of our secrets haue some henting.|
      block |But not the truth with perfect complement,|
      block |Because they neither putrifie, nor alter their Ferment.|
    block
      block |That poynt therefore I will disclose vnto thee,|
      block |Looke how thou didst with thine vnperfect bodie,|
      block |Doe so with thy perfect bodies in each degree,|
      block |That is to say, first thou them putrifie,|
      block |Their former qualities destroying vtterly,|
      block |For this is wholly to our intent,|
      block |That first thou alter before thou ferment.|
    block
      block |To thy compound make firment the fourth part,|
      block |Which ferments been only of Sunne and Moone;|
      block |If thou therefore be maister of this Arte,|
      block |Thy Fermentation let thus be doone,|
      block |Fixe water and earth together soone,|
      block |And when thy medicine as waxe doth flowe,|
      block |Then vpon malgames looke thou it throwe.|
    block
      block |And when all that together is mixed,|
      block |Aboue the glasse well closed make thy fire,|
      block |And so continue it till all be fixed,|
      block |And well fermented to thy defire,|
      block |Then make Proiection after thy pleasure,|
      block |For that is medicine each deale perfite,|
      block |Thus must thou ferment both red and white.|
    block
      block |For like as flowre of wheate made into paste|
      block |Requireth ferment, which leauen we call|
      block |Of bread, that it may haue the kindly taste,|
      block |And become foode to man and woman cordiall:|
      block |Right so thy medicine ferment thou shall,|
      block |That it may taste of the Ferment pure,|
      block |At all assayes for euer to endure.|
    block
      block |And vnderstand that there be Ferments three,|
      block |Two be of bodies in nature cleene,|
      block |Which must be altred as I haue told thee;|
      block |The third most secret of which I meene,|
      block |Is the first earth of his water greene:|
      block |And therefore when the Lion doth thurst,|
      block |Make him to drinke till his belly burst.|
    block
      block |Of this a Question if I should mooue,|
      block |And aske of workers, what is this thing?|
      block |Anon thereby I should them prooue,|
      block |If they had knowledge of our fermenting:|
      block |For manie a man speaketh with wondring,|
      block |Of Robin hood and of his bowe,|
      block |Which neuer shot therein I trowe.|
    block
      block |For Fermentation true as I thee tell,|
      block |Is of the soule with the bodies incorporation,|
      block |Restoring to it the kindly smell,|
      block |With tast and colour by naturall conspissation,|
      block |Of things disseuered, a due reintegration,|
      block |Whereby the bodie of the spirit taketh impression,|
      block |That either the other may help to haue ingression.|
    block
      block |For like as bodies in their compaction corporall,|
      block |May not shewe out their qualities effectually,|
      block |Vntill the time that they become spirituall,|
      block |No more may spirits abide with bodies stedfastly,|
      block |Till they with them be confixate proportionally,|
      block |For then the bodie teacheth the spirit to suffer fire,|
      block |And the spirit the bodie to enter to thy defire.|
    block
      block |Therefore thy gold with gold thou must ferment,|
      block |With his owne water thy earth cleansed I meene,|
      block |Nought else to say but element with element,|
      block |The spirit of life onely going betweene,|
      block |For like as an adamant as thou hast seene|
      block |Draweth yron to him, so doth our earth by kinde,|
      block |Drawe downe to him his soule borne vp with winde.|
    block
      block |With winde therefore the soule lead out and in,|
      block |Mingle gold with gold, that is for to say,|
      block |Make Element with Element togetherrin|
      block |Till time all fire they suffer may,|
      block |For earth is Ferment withouten nay|
      block |To water, and water the earth vnto,|
      block |Our Fermentatio• in this wise must be doe.|
    block
      block |Earth is gold, and so is the soule also|
      block |Not common, but ours thus Elementate,|
      block |And yet thereto the Sunne must goe,|
      block |That by our wheele it may be alterate:|
      block |For so to ferment it must be preparate,|
      block |That it profoundly may ioyned bee,|
      block |With other natures as I said to thee.|
    block
      block |And whatsoeuer I haue here said of gold,|
      block |The same of siluer I will thou vnderstand,|
      block |That thou them putrifie and alter (as I haue told)|
      block |Ere thou thy medicine to firment take in hand:|
      block |Forsooth I could neuer finde him in England|
      block |Which in this wise to firment could me teach|
      block |Withouten error, by practise or by speach.|
    block
      block |Now of this chapter needeth to treate no more,|
      block |Sith I intend prolixitie to eschew;|
      block |Remember well my words therefore,|
      block |Which thou shalt proue by practise trew,|
      block |And Sunne and Moone looke thou renew,|
      block |That they may hold of the fift nature,|
      block |Then shall their tincture euermore endure.|
    block
      block |And yet a way there is most excellent,|
      block |Belonging vnto another working,|
      block |A water we make most redolent,|
      block |All bodies to oyle wherewith we bring,|
      block |With which our medicine we make flowing,|
      block |A quintessence this water we call,|
      block |In man which healeth diseases all.|
    block
      block |But with thy base, after my doctrine preperate|
      block |Which is our calx this must be done,|
      block |For when our bodies be so calcinate,|
      block |That water will to oyle dissolue them soone,|
      block |Make thou therefore oyle both of Sunne and Moone,|
      block |Which is ferment most fragrant for to smell.|
      block |And so the ninth gate is conquered of this Castell.|
    block
      block |The end of the ninth Gate.|

  block |Of Exaltation. The tenth Gate.|
    block
      block |PRoceede we now to the chapter of Exaltation,|
      block |Of which truly thou must haue knowledge pure,|
      block |But little it is different from Sublimation,|
      block |If thou conceiue it right I you ensure,|
      block |Hereto accordeth the holy scripture,|
      block |Christ saying thus, if I exalted be,|
      block |Then shall I draw all things vnto me.|
    block
      block |Our medicine if we exalt right so,|
      block |It shalbe thereby nobilitate,|
      block |That must be done in manners two,|
      block |From time the parties be dispousate,|
      block |Which must be crucified and examinate,|
      block |And then contumulate both man and wife,|
      block |And after reuiued by the spirit of life.|
    block
      block |Then vp to heauen they must exalted be,|
      block |There to be in bodie and soule glorificate,|
      block |For thou must bring them to such subtiltie,|
      block |that they ascend together to be intronizate,|
      block |In cloudes of clearenes to Angels consociate,|
      block |Then shall they draw as thou shalt see,|
      block |Al other bodies to their owne dignitee.|
    block
      block |If thou therefore the bodies wilt exalt,|
      block |First with the spirit of life thou them augment,|
      block |till time the earth be well subtilizate,|
      block |By naturall rectifying of euery Element,|
      block |Them vp exalting into the firmament,|
      block |Then much more precious shall they be than gold,|
      block |Because of the quintessence which they doe holde.|
    block
      block |For when the colde hath ouercome the heate,|
      block |Then into water the Ayre shall turned be,|
      block |And so two contraries together shall meete,|
      block |Till either with orher right well agree,|
      block |So into Ayre the water as I tell thee,|
      block |When heate of colde hath got domination,|
      block |Shall be conuerted by craft of our circulation.|
    block
      block |And of the Ayre then fire haue thou shall,|
      block |By loosing putrifying and subliming,|
      block |And fire thou hast of the earth materiall,|
      block |Thine Elements thus by craft disseuering,|
      block |Most especially thine earth well calcining,|
      block |And when they be each one made pure,|
      block |Then doe they holde all of the first nature.|
    block
      block |On this wise therefore make them be circulate,|
      block |Each into other exalting by and by,|
      block |And all in this one glasse surely sigillate,|
      block |Not with thine hands, but as I teach thee naturally,|
      block |Fire into water then turne first hardly,|
      block |For fire is in Ayre, which is in water existent,|
      block |And this conuersion accordeth to our intent.|
    block
      block |Then furthermore turne on thy wheele,|
      block |That into earth the ayre conuerted be,|
      block |Which will be done also right well,|
      block |For Ayre is in water being in earth trust me,|
      block |The water into fire contrarious in her qualitie,|
      block |Soone turne thou mayst for water in earth is,|
      block |Which is in fire, conuersion true is this.|
    block
      block |The wheele is now neere turned about,|
      block |Into ayre turne earrh which is the proper nest,|
      block |Of other Elements there is no doubt,|
      block |For earth in fire is, which in ayre taketh rest,|
      block |This circulation beginne thou in the west,|
      block |Then into the south, till they exalted bee,|
      block |Proceede duely, as in thy figure I haue taught thee.|
    block
      block |In which processe clearely thou mayst see,|
      block |Frō one extreame how to another thou mayst not go,|
      block |But by a meane, since they in qualities contrarious be,|
      block |And reason will forsooth that it be so,|
      block |As heate into colde, with other contraries •o,|
      block |Without their meanes as moyst to heate and colde,|
      block |Examples sufficient before this I haue tolde.|
    block
      block |Thus haue I taught thee how to make|
      block |Of all thine Elements a perfect circulation,|
      block |And at thy figure example to take,|
      block |How thou shalt make this foresaide Exaltation,|
      block |And of thy medicine in the Elements true graduation,|
      block |Till it be brought to a gueneritie temperate,|
      block |And then thou hast conquered the tenth gate.|
    block
      block |The end of the tenth Gate.|

  block |Of Multiplication. The eleuenth Gate.|
    block
      block |MVltiplication now to declare I proceede,|
      block |Which is by Philosophers in this wise defined|
      block |Augmentation it is of the Elixer indeede,|
      block |In goodnes and quantitie both for white and red,|
      block |Multiplication is therefore as they doe write,|
      block |That thing that doth augmēt medicines in each degree,|
      block |In colour, in odour, in vertue and also in quantitee.|
    block
      block |And why thou mayst this medicine multiplie,|
      block |Infinitely forsooth the cause is this,|
      block |For it is fire, which kindled will neuer die,|
      block |Dwelling with thee, as fire doth in houses,|
      block |Of which one sparke may make more fire ywis,|
      block |As muske in pigments and other spices mo,|
      block |In vertue multiplied, and our medicine right so.|
    block
      block |So he is rich which fire hath lesse or more,|
      block |Because he may so hugely it multiply,|
      block |And right so rich is he which any parte hath in store,|
      block |Of our Elixers which be augmentable infinitely,|
      block |One way if thou dissolue our pouders drye,|
      block |And make often times of them Congelation,|
      block |Thereof in goodnes then makest thou Augmentation.|
    block
      block |The second way both in goodnes and quantitie,|
      block |It multiplyeth by iterate Fermentation,|
      block |As in that chapter I shewed plainely to thee,|
      block |By diuers manners of naturall operation,|
      block |And also in the chapter of our Cibation,|
      block |Where thou mayst know how thou shalt multiplie,|
      block |Thy medicine with Mercurie infinitely.|
    block
      block |But and thou wilt both loose and eke ferment,|
      block |Both more in quantitie and better will it be:|
      block |And in such wise thou mayst it soone augment,|
      block |That in thy glasse it will growe like a tree,|
      block |The tree of Hermes named seemely to see,|
      block |Of which one pippin a thousand will multiplie,|
      block |If thou canst make thy proiection wittely.|
    block
      block |And like as Saffron when it is puluerizate,|
      block |By little and little if it with liquor be|
      block |Tempred, and then with much more liquor dilate,|
      block |Teyneth much more of liquor in quantitie,|
      block |Thā being whole in his grosse nature: so shalt thou see,|
      block |That our Elixer, the more it is made thinne,|
      block |The further in tincture it fastly will rinne.|
    block
      block |Keepe in thy fire therefore both euen and morrow,|
      block |From house to house that thou neede not to rinne,|
      block |Among thy neighbours thy fire to seeke or borrow,|
      block |The more thou keepest, the more good shalt thou win|
      block |Multiplying it alwaies more & more thy glasse within,|
      block |By feeding with Mercurie vnto thy liues end,|
      block |So shalt thou haue more than thou needest to spend.|
    block
      block |This matter is plaine I will no more|
      block |Write thereof, let reason thee guide,|
      block |Be neuer the bolder to sinne therefore,|
      block |But serue thy God the better in each tide:|
      block |And while that thou shalt in this life abide,|
      block |Beare this in minde, forget not I thee pray,|
      block |As thou shalt appeare before God at domes day.|
    block
      block |His owne great giftes therefore and his treasure,|
      block |Dispose thou vertuously, helping the poore at neede,|
      block |That in this world thou mayst to thee procure,|
      block |Mercy and grace with heauenly blisse to meede,|
      block |And pray to God deuoutly that he thee leade,|
      block |In at the twelfth gate, as he can best,|
      block |Soone after then thou shalt end thy conquest.|
    block
      block |The end of the eleuenth gate.|

  block |Of Proiection. The twelfth Gate.|
    block
      block |IN Proiection it shal be proued if our practise be pro∣fitable,|
      block |Of which it behoueth me the secrets here to moue,|
      block |Therefore if thy tincture be sure and not variable,|
      block |By a little of thy medicine thus mayst thou proue,|
      block |With mettle, or with Mercury as pitch it will cleaue,|
      block |And teyne in Proiection all fires to abide,|
      block |And soone it will enter and spread him full wide.|
    block
      block |But many by ignorance doe marre that they made,|
      block |When on mettals vnclensed Proiection they make,|
      block |For because of corruption their tinctures must fade,|
      block |Which they would not away first from the body take,|
      block |Which after Proiection be brittle blew and black,|
      block |That thy tincture therefore may euermore last,|
      block |First vpon ferment thy medicine see thou cast.|
    block
      block |Then brittle as glasse will thy ferment bee,|
      block |Vpon bodies clensed and made very pure,|
      block |Cast that brittle substance and soone shalt thou see,|
      block |That they shall be curiously coloured with tincture,|
      block |With all assayes for euer shall endure,|
      block |But profitable Proiection perfectly to make,|
      block |At the Psalmes of the Psalter example thou take.|
    block
      block |On Fundamenta cast first this psalme Nunc di••ittis,|
      block |Vpon verba mea, then cast Fundamenta beliue,|
      block |Then Verba vpon diligam, conceiue me with thy wits.|
      block |And diligam vpon attendite, if thou list to thriue,|
      block |Thus make thou Proiections, three, foure, or fiue,|
      block |Till the tincture of the medicine beginne to decrease,|
      block |And then it is time of Proiection to cease.|
    block
      block |By this mistie talking I meane nothing else,|
      block |But that thou must cast first the lesse on the more,|
      block |Encreasing aye the number as wisemen thee tells,|
      block |And keepe thou this secreat vnto thy selfe in store,|
      block |Be couetous of cunning it is no burden sore,|
      block |For he that ioyneth not the Elixer with bodies made cleane,|
      block |He wotteth not surely what Proiection doth meane|
    block
      block |Ten if thou multiplie first into ten,|
      block |One hundreth that number maketh sickerly,|
      block |If one hundreth into an hundreth be multiplied, then|
      block |Ten thousand is that number if thou count it wittely,|
      block |Then into as much more ten thousand to multiplie,|
      block |It is a thousand thousand; which multiplied ywis,|
      block |Into as much more a hundreth millions is.|
    block
      block |That hundreth millions being multiplyed likewise|
      block |Into ten thousand millions, as I to thee doe say,|
      block |Maketh so great a number I wot not what it is,|
      block |Thy number in Proiection thus multiplye alway:|
      block |Now childe of thy curtesie for me that thou pray,|
      block |Sith I haue tolde thee our secrets all and some,|
      block |To the which I beseech GOD by grace thou mayst come.|
    block
      block |Now hast thou conquered these gates twelue,|
      block |And all the Castle thou holdest at thy will,|
      block |Keepe thy secreats in store to thy selfe,|
      block |And the commaundements of God looke thou fulfill,|
      block |In fire see thou continue thy glasses still,|
      block |And multiply thy medicines aye more and more,|
      block |For wise men doe say, that store is no sore.|
    block
      block |Recapitulatio totius operis praedicti.|
      block |For to bring this Treatise to a finall ende,|
      block |And briefly here to conclude these secrets all,|
      block |Diligently looke thou, and to thy figure attend,|
      block |Which doth in it containe these secrets great & small,|
      block |And if thou it conceiue, both theoricall and practicall,|
      block |By figures and colours, by scripture plaine,|
    block
      block |It wittily conceiued, thou mayst not worke in vaine.|
    block
      block |Consider first the latitude of this precious Stone,|
      block |Beginning in the first side noted in the West,|
      block |Where the red man & the white woman be made one,|
      block |Spoused with the spirite of life to liue in rest,|
      block |Earth and water equally proportionate, that is best,|
      block |And one of the earth is good, and of the spirit three,|
      block |Which twelue to fowre also of the earth may bee.|
    block
      block |Three of the wife, and one of the man thou take,|
      block |And the lesse of the spirit in this dispousation,|
      block |The rather thy Calcination for certain shalt thou make:|
      block |Then forth into the North proceed by obscuration|
      block |Of the red man and his white wife, called Eclipsation,|
      block |Loosing them and altring them betwixt winter & vere,|
      block |Into water turning earth, darke and nothing cleare.|
    block
      block |From thence by colours many one into the East ascend,|
      block |Then shall the Moone be full appearing by day-light,|
      block |Then is she passed purgatorie, and her course at an end,|
      block |There is the vprising of the Sunne appearing bright.|
      block |There is Summer after Vere, and day after night:|
      block |Thē earth & water which wer black, be turned to aire,|
      block |And clouds of darknes ouerblown, & all apeareth faire.|
    block
      block |And as in the west was the beginning of thy practise.|
      block |And the North the perfect meane of profoūd alteratiō:|
      block |So in the East after them the beginning of speculatiō is:|
      block |But of this course vp in the south the sun maketh cōsū∣matiō.|
      block |Ther bin the elements turned into fire by circulatiō:|
      block |Then to win to thy desire thou needst not be in doubt,|
      block |For the wheele of our philosophie thou hast turned a∣bout|
    block
      block |But yet about againe two times turne thy wheele,|
      block |In which bin cōprehēded all the secrets of our philoso∣phy.|
      block |In chapiters 12. made plaine to thee, if thou cōceiue thē well,|
      block |And all the secrets by & by of our lower Astronomy,|
      block |How thou shalt calcine bodies, perfit, dissolue diuide & putrifie,|
      block |With perfect knowledge of all the poles which in our heauen beene,|
      block |Shining with colours inexplicable, neuer were gayer seene.|
    block
      block |And thus our secret conclusion know withouten faile,|
      block |Our red man teineth not, nor his wife, til they teined be,|
      block |Therefore if thou list thy selfe by this craft to auaile,|
      block |The altitude of the bodies hide, & shewe out their pro∣funditie,|
      block |In euery of thy materials destroying the first qualitie,|
      block |And secondary qualities more glorious in them repaire anone,|
      block |And in one glasse, and with one rule, foure natures turn to one.|
    block
      block |Pale & black with false citrine, imperfect white & red,|
      block |The Peacocks feathers in colours gay, the Rainebowe which shall ouergoe,|
      block |The spotted pāther, the lyō green, the crowes bil blue as lead,|
      block |These shall apeare before thee perfect white, and manie other moe,|
      block |And after the perfect white, gray, false citrine also,|
      block |And after these, thē shall apeare the body red inuariable,|
      block |Then hast thou a medicine of the thirde order of his owne kinde multiplicable.|
    block
      block |Thou must diuide thy white Elixer into parts two|
      block |Before thou rubifie, & into glasses two let thē be doone.|
      block |If thou wilt haue for Sū & moon thy elixer both do so;|
      block |And into mercury thē multiply to great quātity soone,|
      block |And if thou had not at the beginning to fill a spoone,|
      block |Yet maist thou them so multiply both white and red.|
      block |That if thou liue a 1000. yeres, they shall stād thee in sted.|
    block
      block |Haue thou recourse to thy wheele therefore I counsell thee,|
      block |And studie him well to know in each chapter truly,|
      block |Meddle with no phantasticall multipliers, but let thē be,|
      block |Which will thee flatter feining them cunning in Phi∣losophie,|
      block |Doe as I bid thee, thē dissolue these foresaid bases wit∣tilie,|
      block |And turne them into perfect oyles with our true water ardent,|
      block |By circulation that must be done according to our in∣tent.|
    block
      block |These oyles will fixe crude Mercurie and conuert bo∣dies all|
      block |Into perfect Sunne and Moone, when thou shalt make Proiection;|
      block |That oylie substance pure & fixt Raimond Lully did call|
      block |His Basiliske, of which he neuer made so plain detectiō:|
      block |Pray for me to God, that I may be one of his election,|
      block |And that he will for one of his, at doomesday me ken▪|
      block |And graunt me his blisse to raigne with him for euer. Amen.|
    block
      block |Finis Recapitulationis.|
    block
      block |An Admonition, wherein the Author declareth his erronious Experiments.|
      block |AFter all this, I will thou vnderstand|
      block |For thy sauegard, what I haue doone,|
      block |Manie experiments haue I taken in hand|
      block |As I found written for Sunne and Moone:|
      block |The which I will tell thee, rehearsing soone,|
      block |Beginning at the vermilion, which proued nought,|
    block
      block |And Mercurie sublimed, which I dearly bought.|
      block |I made solutions full manie a one|
      block |Of spirits, ferments, salts, yron, and steele,|
      block |Weening so to make the Philosophers Stone:|
      block |But finally I lost euery deele,|
      block |After my bookes yet wrought I weele,|
      block |Which euermore vntrue I preeued,|
    block
      block |Which made me oft full sore agreeued.|
      block |Waters corsiue and waters ardent,|
      block |With which I wrought in diuers wise,|
      block |Manie one I made, but all were shent,|
      block |Egg-shells I calcined twice or thrise,|
      block |Oyles from Calxes I made vp to rise,|
      block |And euery Element I did from other twin,|
    block
      block |But profit found I none therein.|
    block
      block |Also I wrought in sulphure and vitriall,|
      block |Which fooles doe call the greene Lyon,|
      block |In Arsinike, in orpiment, foule them befall,|
      block |In debili principio was my inception,|
      block |Therefore in fine, was fraude my conclusion:|
      block |And thus I blew my thrift at the cole,|
      block |My cloathes were bawdie, my stomacke neuer whole.|
    block
      block |Sal Armoniacke, and Sandiuere,|
      block |Sal Alcalie, Sal allembroke, and Sal attinckarre,|
      block |Sal tartar, salt common, Sal gem most cleare,|
      block |Salt Peter, salt sod, of these beware,|
      block |And from the odour of quicksiluer keepe thee farre,|
      block |Meddle not with Mercurie precipitate,|
      block |Neither with imperfect bodies rubificate.|
    block
      block |I prooued vrine, eggs, haire and blood,|
      block |The soule of Saturne, and also of markazite,|
      block |Aes vst, and Crokefeere, which did me neuer good,|
      block |And the scales of yron which Smithes of smite,|
      block |Litarge and Antimonie, not worth a mite;|
      block |Of the which gay tinctures did I shew,|
      block |Both red and white, which were vntrew.|
    block
      block |Oyle of lyme, and water with labour great|
      block |I made, calcining it with salt preperate,|
      block |And by it selfe with violent heate,|
      block |Grinding with vineger till I was fatigate,|
      block |And also with aqua vitae, with spices acuate|
      block |Vpon a marble Stone, which stood me in cost,|
      block |And oyles with corosiues I made; but all was lost.|
    block
      block |Manie a Malgame did I make,|
      block |Weening to fixe them to great auaile,|
      block |And thereto Sulphure did I take,|
      block |Tartar, egges, whites, and oyle of the snayle,|
      block |But euer of my purpose did I faile,|
      block |For what for the more, and what for the las,|
      block |Euermore something wanting there was.|
    block
      block |Wine and milke, oyles and rennyt,|
      block |The slyme of starres that fall on ground,|
      block |Celedonie with Secundines and many mo yet;|
      block |In these I practised as I in bookes found,|
      block |I wan right nought, but lost many a pound,|
      block |Of Mercurie and mettalls I made christall stones,|
      block |Weening it had been a worke for the nones.|
    block
      block |Thus I rosted and broyled, as one of Gebers cookes,|
      block |Oft times in the asshes my winning I sought,|
      block |For I was deceiued by manie false bookes,|
      block |Whereby vntruth truly I wrought,|
      block |But all such experiments auailed me right nought,|
      block |But brought me in danger and encumbrance,|
      block |By losse of my goods and other greeuance.|
    block
      block |For the loue of our Ladie such lewdnes eschew,|
      block |And medle with no falshood, that neuer proued weele,|
      block |Assay when thee liketh, and thou shalt finde it trew,|
      block |Winne shalt thou right nought, but lose euerie deele,|
      block |Pence in thy purse pawtner few shalt thou feele,|
      block |In smokes and in smels thou shalt haue much woe,|
      block |That vnneth for sicknes on earth thou shalt goe.|
    block
      block |I sawe neuer true worke truly but one,|
      block |Of which in this Treatise the truth I haue told:|
      block |Studie only therefore how to make our Stone,|
      block |For thereby maist thou winne both siluer and gold,|
      block |Vpon my writing therefore, to ground thee be bold:|
      block |So shalt thou loose nought if God be thy guide,|
      block |Trust to my doctrine, and thereby abide.|
    block
      block |Remember that Man is most noble creature|
      block |Of earthly composition, that euer God wrought,|
      block |In whō is the foure Elements, proportioned by nature,|
      block |A naturall Mercurialitie, which costeth right nought,|
      block |One of his myner by arte it is brought;|
      block |For our mettalls be nought els but our myners two,|
      block |Of Sunne and Moone, wise Raymond said so.|
    block
      block |The clearnes of the Moone, and of the Sunne so bright,|
      block |Into these two myners descendeth secretly,|
      block |Howbeit the clearnes is hid from thy sight,|
      block |Which by craft thou shalt make it to appeare openly:|
      block |This hid Stone, this one thing therefore putrifie,|
      block |And wash him in his owne broth till white he become;|
      block |Then ferment him wittily; loe here is all and some.|
    block
      block |Now to God Almightie I thee commend,|

      block |The Epistle by the same Author written to King Edward the 4.|
      block |O Honorable Lord, and most victorious Knight,|
      block |With grace and vertue abundantly endewed,|
      block |The safegard of England, and maintainer of right;|
      block |That God you loueth, indeed he hath well shewed:|
      block |Wherefore I trust this land shalbe renewed|
      block |With ioy and riches, with charitie and peace,|
    block
      block |So that olde ranckors new vnderstrewed,|
      block |Tempestuous troubles, and wretchednes shall cease.|
      block |And therefore sith I see by tokens right euident,|
      block |That God you guideth, and how that you be vertuous,|
      block |Hating sinne, and all such as be insolent,|
      block |How that also manslaughter to you is odious,|
      block |Vpon the iudgement also that you be piteous:|
    block
      block |Me seemeth ruthe it were but that you should liue long;|
      block |For of your great fortune you are not presumptuous,|
      block |Nor vengeable of spirit to reuenge you of each wrong.|
      block |These considered with others in your most noble State,|
      block |Like as God knoweth, and people doe witnes beare,|
      block |So entirely me m•oueth, that I must algate|
      block |Record the same, and therein be no flatterer:|
    block
      block |And not that only, but also to write here|
      block |Vnto your Highnes, humbly to present|
      block |Great secrets, which infarre countries I did learne,|
      block |And which by grace to me most vnworthie are lent.|
    block
      block |Once to your Lordship such things I did promise,|
      block |What time you did commaund to send vnto me,|
      block |And sith that I wrote it in secret wise,|
      block |Vnto your grace from the Vniuersitie|
      block |Of Louaine, when God fortuned me by grace to see|
      block |Greater secrets and much more perfite,|
      block |Which onely to you I will disclosed to be,|
    block
      block |That is the great Elixer both red and white.|
      block |For like it you to trust that truly I haue found,|
      block |The perfect way of most secret Alchymie,|
      block |Which I will neuer truly for marke nor for pound|
      block |Make common but to you, and that conditionally,|
      block |That to youre selfe you shall keepe it full secretly,|
      block |And only to vse it as may be to Gods pleasure,|
    block
      block |Else in time comming to God I should abye,|
      block |For my discouering of his secret treasure.|
      block |Therefore be you well aduised and with good deliberation,|
      block |For of this secret shall know no other creature,|
      block |But onely you as J make faithfull protestation,|
      block |For all the time that herein life J shall endure,|
      block |Whereto J will your Lordship me ensure,|
    block
      block |To my desire in this my oath for to agree,|
      block |Least I to me the wrath of God procure,|
      block |For such reuealing of his great gift and priuitie.|
      block |If God fortune you by me to win this treasure,|
      block |Serue him deuowtly with more lawde and thanking,|
      block |Praying his Godhead in life that you may so endure,|
      block |His gifts of grace, and fortune to vse to his pleasing,|
    block
      block |Most especially intending ouer all thing,|
      block |To your power and cunning his precepts ten|
      block |So to obserue, that into no danger your selfe you bring,|
      block |But that you in glory may see him hereafter, Amen.|
    block
      block |And yet moreouer I will your Lordship to pardon me,|
      block |For openly with pen I will it neuer it write,|
      block |But whensoeuer you list by practise you shall see,|
      block |By mouth also this precious secret, most of delight,|
      block |How may be made perfect Elixers both red and white,|
      block |Plaine vnto your Lordship it shall declared be,|
      block |And if it please you, with easie expences and respite,|
    block
      block |I will them worke by grace of the Trinitie.|
      block |But notwithstanding for perill that may befall,|
      block |If I dare not here plainely the knotte vnbinde,|
      block |Yet in my writing I will not be so misticall,|
      block |But that by studie the true knowledge you may finde,|
      block |How that each thing is multiplied in his kinde,|
      block |And how the likenes of bodies metaline be transmutable|
    block
      block |I will declare, that if you feele me in your minde,|
      block |My writing you shall finde true and no fained fable.|
      block |As Philosophers in the m•the•rs doe write,|
      block |The likenes of bodies mataline be not transmutable,|
      block |But after he added these wordes of more delight,|
      block |Without they be reduced to their beginning materiable,|
      block |Wherefore such bodies within nature be liquiable,|
    block
      block |Minerall and metaline may be mercurizate,|
      block |Conceiue you may this science is not opinionable,|
      block |But very true, by Raymond and others determinate,|
      block |In the saide booke the Philosophers speake also,|
      block |Therein if it please your Highnes for to reade,|
      block |Of diuers sulphures, and especially of two,|
      block |And of two mercuries ioyned to them indeed,|
    block
      block |Whereby he doth true vnderstanders leade,|
      block |To the knowledge of the principle which is onely trew,|
      block |Both red, moist, pure, and white, as I haue espied,|
      block |Which be neuerthelesse found but of verie few.|
    block
      block |And these two things be best, he addeth anone|
      block |For him that worketh the Alchymie to take:|
      block |Our golde and our siluer therewith to make all one,|
      block |Wherefore I say who will our pearle and Ruby make,|
      block |The said principles looke he not forsake:|
      block |For at the beginning, if his principles be true,|
      block |And if so be by craft he can them also bake,|
    block
      block |In th'end truly his worke he shall not rue.|
      block |But one great secret right needfull to be knowne,|
      block |That though the Philosophers speake plurally,|
      block |All is but one thing you may me well trowe,|
      block |In kinde which is our base principally,|
      block |Whereof doth spring both white and red naturally,|
      block |And yet the white must come first out of the red,|
    block
      block |Which thing is not wrought manually,|
      block |But naturally, craft helping out of our lead.|
      block |For all the partes of our most precious stone,|
      block |As I can proue, be coessentiall and concrete,|
      block |Moreouer there is no true principle but one,|
      block |Full long it was ere I therewith could meete,|
      block |Who can reduce him and knoweth his heate,|
    block
      block |And onely kinde with kinde can well redresse,|
      block |Till filthie originall be clensed from his seate,|
      block |He likely is to finde our secrets more and lesse.|
      block |Therefore worke kinde onely with his owne kinde,|
      block |And so your Elements ioyne that they not striue▪|
      block |This poynt also for any beare in minde,|
      block |That passiue natures you turne into actiue,|
    block
      block |Of water, fire, and winde of earth make bliue,|
      block |And of the quadrangle make a figure round,|
      block |Then haue thou the honie of our bee-hiue,|
      block |One ounce well worth one thousand pound.|
    block
      block |The principall secret of secrets all,|
      block |Is true proportion which may not be behinde,|
      block |Wherein I counsell thee be not superficiall,|
      block |The true conclusion if you thinke to finde,|
      block |Turne earth into water and water into winde,|
      block |Therefore make fire and beware of the flood|
      block |Of Noah, wherein many men are so blinde,|
    block
      block |That by this science they get little good.|
      block |I counsell you eate and drink temperately,|
      block |And beware well that Iposarcha come not in place,|
      block |Neshe not your wombe by drinking immoderately,|
      block |Least you quench naturall heate in little space,|
      block |The colour will tell appearing in your face,|
      block |Drinke no more therefore than you may eate,|
    block
      block |Walke vp and downe after an easie pace,|
      block |Chafe not your bodie too sore to sweate.|
      block |With easie fire after mouing when you sweate,|
      block |Warme your bodie and make it drie againe,|
      block |By riuers and fountaines walke after meate,|
      block |At morning time visit the high mountaine,|
      block |That Phisick so biddeth I read certaine,|
    block
      block |So high the mountaines yet doe you not ascend,|
      block |But that you may downwardes your way haue plaine,|
      block |And with your mantle from colde ye you defend.|
      block |Such labour is wholesome your sweat for to drie|
      block |With napkin, and after it see you take no colde,|
      block |For grosse humors be purged by sweate kindely,|
      block |Vse Diacameron then confect with perfect golde,|
    block
      block |Hermidocles for watry humors good I holde,|
      block |Vse Jpericon perforat with milke of tincturiall,|
      block |And sperma Caeti with red wine, and when you wax olde,|
      block |And Goats milke sod with wine nourisheth moysture radicall.|
    block
      block |But a good Phisition who so intendeth to be,|
      block |Our lower Astronomie needeth well to know,|
      block |And after that to learne well vrine in a glasse to see,|
      block |And if it neede to be chafed the fire for to blow,|
      block |Then wittily it by diuers wayes for to throw|
      block |After the cause to make a medicine bliue,|
      block |Truly telling the infirmities all on a row,|
    block
      block |Who this can doe by his Phisick is like to thriue.|
      block |VVe haue our heauen incorruptible of the quintessence,|
      block |Ornate with signes, Elements, and starres bright,|
      block |VVhich moysteth our earth by subtill influence,|
      block |And of it a secret sulphure hid from sight,|
      block |It fetcheth by vertue of his actiue might,|
      block |Like as the Bee fetcheth honey out of the flower,|
    block
      block |VVhich thing could doe no other worldly wight.|
      block |Therefore to God be all glory and honour.|
      block |And like as yee to water doth relent,|
      block |VVhere it was congealed by violence of colde,|
      block |VVhen Phoebus it shineth with his heate influent,|
      block |Euen so to water minerall reduced is our golde,|
      block |As witnesseth plainely, Albert, Raymond, and Arnold,|
    block
      block |By heate and moysture and by craft occasionate,|
      block |VVhich congelation of the spirits, loe now J haue tolde,|
      block |How our materialls together must be proportionate.|
      block |At the dyers craft you may learne this science,|
      block |Beholding with water how decoction they make|
      block |Vpon the wad or madder easily and with patience,|
      block |Till tinctures doe appeare which then the cloth doth take,|
    block
      block |Therein so fixed that they will neuer forsake|
      block |The cloth, for washing after they ioyned be,|
      block |Euen so our tinctures with the water of our lake,|
      block |VVe draw by boyling vvith the ashes of Hermes tree.|
    block
      block |Which tinctures when they by craft are made perfite,|
      block |So dyeth mettles with colours aye permanent,|
      block |After the qualitie of the medicine, red or white,|
      block |That neuer away with anie fire wilbe brent:|
      block |To this example if you take good tent,|
      block |Vnto your purpose the rather you shall winne.|
      block |And let your fire be easie, and not too feruent,|
    block
      block |Where nature did leaue what time you did beginne.|
      block |First calcine, and after that putrifie,|
      block |Dissolue, distill, sublime, discend and fixe,|
      block |With Aqua vitae oft times both wash and drie,|
      block |And make a marriage the bodie and spirite betwixt,|
      block |Which thus together naturallie if you can mixe,|
      block |In loosing of the bodie the water congeald shalbe,|
    block
      block |Then shall the bodie die vtterlie of the flixe,|
      block |Bleeding and changing his colours, as you shall see.|
      block |The third day againe to life he shall arise,|
      block |And deuoure birds, and beasts of the wildernesse,|
      block |Crowes, popingaies, pies, peacocks, and mauois,|
      block |The Phoenix, with the Eagle, and the Griffin of fearfulnesse,|
      block |The greene Lion, with the red Dragon he shall distresse,|
    block
      block |With the white Dragon, and the Antelop, Vnicorne & Panther,|
      block |With other beasts and birds both more and lesse,|
      block |The Basiliske also, which almost each one doth feare.|
      block |Jn bus and nibus he shall arise and descend,|
      block |Vp to the Moone, and sith vp to the Sunne,|
      block |Through the Ocean sea, which round is withouten end,|
      block |Onely shippen within a little glassen tunne;|
    block
      block |When he is there come, then is the mastrie wonne:|
      block |About which iourney, great goods you shall not spend,|
      block |And yet you shall be glad that euer it was begunne,|
      block |Patiently if you list to your worke attend.|
    block
      block |For then both bodie and spirite with oyle and water,|
      block |Soule, and tincture, one thing both white and red,|
      block |After colours variable it containeth, whatsouer men clatter;|
      block |Which also is called after he hath once been dead|
      block |And is reuiued, our Markaside, our Magnet, and our lead,|
      block |Our Sulphur, our Arsinike, and our true Calx viue,|
      block |Our Sunne, our Moone, our ferment and our bread,|
    block
      block |Our toad, our Basiliske▪ our vnknowen bodie, our man, our wife.|
      block |Our bodie thus naturally by craft when he is renouate|
      block |Of the first order, is medicine called in our Philosophie;|
      block |Which oftentimes againe must be propertualicate,|
      block |The round wheele turning of our Astronomie,|
      block |And so to the Elixer of spirits you must come: for why|
      block |Till the sonne of the fixed by the sonne of the fixer be ouergone,|
    block
      block |Elixer of bodies, named it is onely,|
      block |And this found secret poynt, deceaueth manie one.|
      block |This naturall proces by helpe of craft thus consummate,|
      block |Dissolueth Elixer spirituall in our vnctuous humiditie,|
      block |Then in Balneo Mare together let them be circulate,|
      block |Like new honie or oyle, till perfectly they be thickned.|
      block |Then will that medicine heale all infirmitie,|
    block
      block |And turne all mettals to Sunne and Moone perfectly,|
      block |Thus you shall make the great Elixer, and Aurum potabile,|
      block |By the grace and will of God, to whom be all honour and glorie.|
      block |Amen. quod George Ripley.|
